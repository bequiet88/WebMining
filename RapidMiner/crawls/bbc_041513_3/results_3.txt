24.04.2013 23:34:05 Manchester United wrapped up a 20th league title in convincing style after Robin van Persie's first-half hat-trick sank Aston Villa. The Dutch striker has been United's stellar striker for much of the season before labouring of late after two goals in his previous seven Premier League appearances. But the Â£24m summer signing returned to form in spectacular fashion to secure the silverware with four games to spare. Defeat for Manchester City at Tottenham on Sunday meant that United knew before kick-off that victory would be enough for them to cross the line. Despite an improved second-half showing by Villa, now three points above the relegation zone with four games remaining, that outcome never seriously looked in doubt. United boss Sir Alex Ferguson has now won the Premier League 13 times but the manner and margin of this triumph, a year after seeing the title wrenched from his grasp by City with the last kick of the season, should give him as much satisfaction as his first success. His side were already 13 points clear before kick-off, and there was an air of expectation bordering on euphoria at Old Trafford. If there were any nerves too, they went out of the window when Van Persie opened the scoring after 83 seconds. A move started by Wayne Rooney ended with Ryan Giggs knocking Antonio Valencia's cross into the path of the Dutchman, who converted from two yards out. It was an ominous start for a defence looking as vulnerable as Villa's, and more chances swiftly followed. The visitors escaped when Van Persie headed over and Rafael fired against the post but a second goal was not far away. Villa had just started to gain a foothold in the match, with Christian Benteke firing just over after a quick break, when United struck again in devastating fashion after 13 minutes. This time it was the home side on the counter-attack, and Rooney's searching ball found Van Persie running to meet it on the edge of the area to smash an unstoppable left-footed volley past Brad Guzan. It was a world-class strike worthy of putting the seal on a title that has been in United's grasp since early February, when they first moved 12 points clear, but he and United did not stop there. Giggs ran on to Shinji Kagawa's pass and had a chance to let fly himself, but instead set up Van Persie, who steadied himself before firing high into the roof of the net. His 31-minute hat-trick not only put the win and the title beyond doubt, it also moved the summer signing to 24 league goals - one above Liverpool's Luis Suarez as the Premier League's leading scorer. At that stage Villa's prime concern was damage limitation, especially because goal difference could yet play a part in their fight for survival, but to their credit they regrouped for the second half. It took a goal-line clearance from Van Persie to stop Andreas Weimann from pulling a goal back and David De Gea was called into action to keep out Benteke's low shot. United's players could be forgiven for having their minds on the parade to come at the final whistle, and even with the encouragement of Ferguson on the touchline, they failed to hit the heights they had managed before half-time. Villa went close again when Weimann curled an effort wide from the right of the box and, even when United did respond, Kagawa wasted an easy chance to make it 4-0 when he fired over with the goal gaping. The spirit shown by Paul Lambert's side bodes well for their battle against the drop. But it only succeeded in taking the edge off the celebrations from the home fans in the stands during the second half. They made up for it at the final whistle when the ground let out a collective roar of delight. Ferguson embraced his players as they completed a lap of honour - one they will repeat on 12 May after their game against Swansea when they will be handed the Premier League trophy.

24.04.2013 23:34:05 West Ham's clinical victory over Wigan appeared to end any lingering worries they had about relegation but caused further anxiety for the Latics. The irrepressible Shaun Maloney had an effort stopped by Jussi Jaaskelainen before Matt Jarvis was fortunate to find the bottom corner from his cross. Wigan had a host of chances after the break with James McArthur closest. Kevin Nolan's late volley then came against the run of play, keeping Wigan in the Premier League's bottom three. Andy Carroll fired wide with a late effort after latching onto a long ball from the back, for what would have been a truly unrepresentative scoreline. But Wigan will feel frustrated by their inability to make their second-half dominance count, wasting a chance to close in on relegation rivals Aston Villa who play Manchester United on Monday. Villa sit three points above Wigan, but with Stoke and Sunderland both winning, it was a poor day for Latics boss Roberto Martinez who last weekend watched his side secure a place in the FA Cup final. Thoughts about that occasion must now be put to one side as the Spaniard aims to secure his team's Premier League safety, starting with the visit of Tottenham next Saturday. His position is far different from West Ham boss Sam Allardyce, whose team are now five league games unbeaten and sit 11 points above the relegation zone with four games left. In what turned out to be a reflection of the game, Wigan enjoyed a dominant spell of possession in the first 20 minutes. Maloney began brightly and had the the visitors' best chance to open the scoring when he was slipped through the middle by Callum McManaman, but Jaaskelainen was quick to come off his line and save the Scot's effort. West Ham appeared content to remain compact rather than chase the ball and before the goal they were limited in their attacking forays. In contrast to Wigan's short-sharp passing, Carroll was eager to profit from any set-pieces and he went into the book early on for what looked like a petty reaction to Gary Caldwell's attentions. That was soon forgotten, though, when the Hammers took the lead as Jarvis advanced down the left, cut back, and his cross carried all the way into the bottom corner as Mohamed Diame attempted to poke it in against his former club. The goal gave the hosts an instant boost and Carroll increased his influence while Nolan had a penalty appeal waved away by referee Neil Swarbrick. Wigan recovered after the break when Martinez's decision to replace McManaman with McArthur allowed Jordi Gomez to play further forward and the Spanish midfielder tested Jaaskelainen. Efforts from Emmerson Boyce, McArthur and Jean Beausejour were all then saved by West Ham's Finnish goalkeeper, with another to deny McArthur following Maloney's cut-back the best of the bunch. Maloney was a menace in the second half and Allardyce's team struggled to get out of their own half, much to the home supporters' frustration. But they were soon singing their famous 'I'm forever blowing bubbles' song when from a long-free-kick, Carroll chested the ball down, hooked it over his head and Nolan stole in to volley his 100th career goal.  West Ham boss Sam Allardyce: "While it wasn't the best performance, the bottom line is, if you score your goals and take your chances, you win football matches. "Their possession was better than ours but the chances they had they either missed or Jussi Jaaskelainen saved them. We knew Wigan would push forward which left them defensively weakened and we exposed them."

24.04.2013 23:34:05 Substitute Adam Le Fondre scored a late double as Reading fought back from two behind against Chelsea to climb out of the Premier League relegation zone. Blues midfielder Juan Mata opened the scoring in first-half injury-time with a fierce strike across Adam Federici. Frank Lampard's thumping header from Mata's corner put third-placed Chelsea firmly in command at the Madejski. But Le Fondre fired in Hope Akpan's pass before guiding in a stoppage-time leveller in a dramatic finale. Reading knew they only needed a point to move above relegation rivals Wigan and Aston Villa out of the bottom three, but seemed set to remain in danger as Chelsea took command. However, the Royals were rescued once again by Le Fondre, who also came off the bench to score twice in six minutes in their 2-1 win at Newcastle.  The introduction of fellow substitute Akpan, a recent signing from League One side Crawley Town, also proved instrumental as he provided both goals for Le Fondre. His clever throughball enabled Le Fondre to fire past stand-in Chelsea goalkeeper Ross Turnbull, again replacing the injured Petr Cech, at his near post. Turnbull had not even been forced into a save before Le Fondre's first and was left stunned as the ex-Rotherham striker earned Reading an unlikely point in the fifth minute of stoppage time. Home goalkeeper Federici launched a long free-kick into the Chelsea box and the visiting defence, minus John Terry who was on the bench, failed to cope with the high ball. It allowed Jimmy Kebe, and then Akpan, to head into the path of Le Fondre, who managed to keep his composure and score his seventh goal in five matches. Chelsea were left stunned by the double salvo, which will crank up the pressure on Blues boss Rafael Benitez - again the target of jeers from the away supporters. The visitors were firmly on course to secure their fifth successive top-flight victory on the road and reduce the deficit on second-placed Manchester City to four points. A dull first-half sparked into life 50 seconds into stoppage-time as Reading were carved open by a slick one-touch move from the visitors. Ramires, Oscar and Mata combined for Fernando Torres to scoop the ball into the path of fellow Spaniard Mata who swept a low half-volley across Federici into his bottom left-hand corner. Before Mata's goal, Chelsea's only periods of sustained pressure came after mistakes from Reading carelessly handed possession back to Blues. And another error allowed Lampard to burst forward as Chelsea forced the corner which led to his goal. It was the England midfielder's 10th goal of the season and puts him just six goals adrift of Bobby Tambling's all-time record of 202 goals for the west London club. Brazilian midfielder Oscar could have added a third when he was released by substitute Yossi Benayoun's pass, only to be denied by the on-rushing Federici. And it proved costly as Le Fondre intervened to earn Reading's seventh point from their last three Premier League games.  Reading boss Brian McDermott:  "You definitely didn't see that coming. But we've had it here at the Madejski before with 10 minutes to go. We've done it so many times. "We weren't really in the game, just trying to get a foothold and trying to change things to get something. "Hope Akpan came on the pitch and made a couple of goals too. He was terrific. "That's why we talk about the group and what they all mean to us. They all made a difference for us today."

24.04.2013 23:34:05 Arsenal rescued a point with a stirring comeback after Liverpool looked like they would recover from their shock FA Cup defeat by Oldham with victory at Emirates Stadium. Luis Suarez and Jordan Henderson took full advantage of an Arsenal defensive display that plumbed the depths to put Brendan Rodgers's side on course for victory after an hour. But Arsenal showed great resolve to respond swiftly and score twice inside three minutes through Olivier Giroud and Theo Walcott and ensure a thrilling game ended in a draw. Liverpool will be disappointed at conceding that two-goal advantage while Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger may regard a point as a relief, such was the generosity of the defending that presented the visitors with so many opportunities. Defender Martin Skrtel paid the price for Liverpool's FA Cup loss at League One Oldham as he was dropped in favour of Jamie Carragher. If Carragher's presence was designed to give Liverpool's rearguard more security, Arsenal spent the first 45 minutes producing such an utterly chaotic defensive shambles that they were lucky not to be punished more heavily than they were. The tone was set when Liverpool took the lead after five minutes. Bacary Sagna fell over as Suarez missed a flick and when Arsenal failed to clear after Wojciech Szczesny saved from Daniel Sturridge, the Uruguayan scored with the help of a deflection. Liverpool keeper Pepe Reina prevented Arsenal equalising instantly as he blocked a Walcott effort at his near post - and it was not long before Suarez was creating more havoc for Arsenal. He released Sturridge with a magical swerving pass with the outside of his foot but his strike partner chose to take the chance first time and rolled his effort tamely wide. Walcott was Arsenal's main danger and he forced another excellent diving save from Reina, but any good work the Gunners were doing in attack was being badly undermined by a succession of calamities at the other end. Lukas Podolski cleared Daniel Agger's header off the line and Henderson landed an effort on the roof of the net with Szczesny stranded out of his ground trying to rescue another desperate situation. Arsenal had suffered a blow when the luckless Kieran Gibbs limped off to be replaced by Andre Santos but there could be no excuse for the standard of defending that had presented Liverpool with so much space and opportunity. There was no escape for Arsenal as Liverpool doubled their lead on the hour. In a moment that encapsulated the game to that point, Henderson battled his way past four home defenders in the area before rolling home a goal his determination deserved. Arsenal, perhaps in desperation, suddenly roused themselves and were level within seven minutes. Giroud powered in a close-range header then Walcott got his reward with a fine angled shot that carried too much pace and power for Reina. As both sides continued to attack, Santi Cazorla flashed a shot across the face of goal and Reina excelled once more as he dived to his right to save from Giroud. Giroud was then unable to complete Arsenal's recovery and put them ahead as he failed to make firm contact with Podokski's cross fromsix yards out. Liverpool had a chance of their own in stoppage time when Santos, unsurprisingly, gifted the visitors possession in a dangerous area and it took a sharp stop from Szczesny to deny Suarez and ensure Arsenal's recovery earned them a point.  Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger: "We created many chances going forward but were nervous defensively. The goals we have conceded show we were nervous from the start. "It was entertainment. We could honestly have lost the game but could have won it by three or four goals."  Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers: "There is an initial disappointment when you are 2-0 up [and draw] but we knew Arsenal were going to have a spell. "We could have had a few more goals but my overriding emotion is one of pride. These players have been brilliant."

24.04.2013 23:34:05 Leighton Baines scored two first-half goals as Everton boosted their top-four hopes with a narrow win over West Brom. Baines opened the scoring with a fine strike from the edge of the box before converting a penalty after Claudio Yacob's foul on Victor Anichebe. The deficit was halved when Shane Long headed in after John Heitinga's poor clearance from Romelu Lukaku's shot. Graham Dorrans and Steven Pienaar both hit the woodwork in a tense finale as chances went amiss at both ends. The result moved Everton within a point of fourth-placed Tottenham, while West Brom's worrying dip in form continued and they have now claimed just one point from their last five Premier League matches. David Moyes, who pulled out of an Â£8.6m deal for Leroy Fer earlier in the day, left Nikica Jelavic out of his starting line-up, with Heitinga restored. Jerome Thomas came into the Baggies side for Peter Odemwingie who, as expected, was absent from the squad on compassionate leave after his new-born son was taken ill. The future of the forward, who has been the subject of two failed bids from Queens Park Rangers, will now be resolved on Thursday's deadline-day. Everton came inches away from an opener in the 19th minute when an Anichebe knockdown found Marouane Fellaini, whose effort from the right side of the penalty box cannoned off the outside of the right upright. However, Moyes's side had just another 10 minutes to wait for their opener as Baines finished the move he started, eventually racing onto Leon Osman's measured pass down the left channel before unleashing an unstoppable swerving strike inside the top-left corner. The Baggies suffered a further setback when George Thorne collapsed to the ground holding his knee after jostling for possession with Osman and the midfielder was carried from the field on a stretcher. Yacob was introduced in Thorne's place but the Argentinian's first meaningful contribution was to give away a penalty for a barge on Anichebe. Baines stepped up and sent Ben Foster the wrong way with a low shot into the bottom-right hand corner for his sixth goal of the season. West Brom improved after the interval and Lukaku served an early warning when he fired over from Thomas's pass within seconds of the restart. But Steve Clarke's team were celebrating midway through the second half when Lukaku rounded Tim Howard and fired goalwards. Heitinga's attempts to control the ball on the line ended disastrously as the ball spun up invitingly for substitute Long, who headed in from close range. The Baggies almost drew level in the 67th minute when Dorrans curled a stunning free-kick against the right-angle of the crossbar after Phil Neville had fouled Yacob. Yet they had a fortunate escape of their own late on when Osman somehow blazed over the crossbar from point-blank range with the goal gaping after Pienaar's shot against the left post had fallen into his path.  Everton manager David Moyes: "I thought it should have been more straightforward. We gave away a really shabby goal. We had a great chance to make it three (via Osman). "Leighton is a special player and he continues to add something to our team. I see him getting better in lots of ways, his football intelligence and how he can improve his and the team's performances."  West Brom head coach Steve Clarke: "It's disappointing. It's not been a good start to the year for us. We gave ourselves too much to do and we have been doing that too much recently. "Of course it's a worry if you give two goals away, it's very unusual you come back. "Maybe with a bit more composure we could have got something out of it. Graham Dorrans was unlucky with the free-kick against the crossbar. We need to dig in. The harder you work, the luckier you get."

24.04.2013 23:34:05 Tottenham's Gareth Bale broke from his own half to score a stunning solo goal and deny Norwich victory. The Canaries were much improved from their humbling FA Cup defeat by non-league Luton and went ahead through a well-worked Wes Hoolahan effort. Sebastien Bassong was inches from doubling the lead before Spurs finally threatened through Jermain Defoe. The visitors were the better team after the break and Bale finished expertly after a 60-yard dash to earn the draw. Champions League-chasing Spurs were unbeaten in seven games, while Norwich had slid towards the Premier League relegation zone after taking one point from the previous 18 points available.  However, City, who held Spurs at White Hart Lane in the Premier League earlier this season and beat them in the League Cup, edged a scrappy start. The swirling wind at Carrow Road was causing problems for Spurs and goalkeeper Hugo Lloris had to tip a header from Grant Holt around the post after Michael Dawson failed to deal with a cross. That was a sign of things to come and the breakthrough for the Canaries came when Hoolahan put them ahead from six yards. The Spurs defence was absent as Snodgrass's deep centre found Holt, who nodded back to Anthony Pilkington, with the winger then showing excellent composure to pass to the well-placed Hoolahan. At that stage, there was a real lack of energy from the pedestrian north London side, a state of affairs not matched by their opponents. The contrast in industry was exemplified when centre-back Bassong was denied a second goal for Norwich from two yards after he was edged out when he followed up his own pass from the halfway line. Bassong was then saved by the fingertips of his goalkeeper Mark Bunn just before the interval after he was caught in possession by Defoe for the visitors' first effort on target. Norwich had conceded 11 goals in their last four league games and there were signs of Spurs slowly trying to probe that weakness after the break. Bale - who mostly operated in the middle of the pitch - forced a decent save from distance before Defoe blazed over after dribbling past Russell Martin. Tottenham finally began to build some sustained pressure but were unable to pick a gap in the massed Norwich defence. Manager Andre Villas-Boas handed German playmaker Lewis Holtby a debut from the bench but it was a moment of razor-sharp incision from Bale that saw them draw level. There seemed to be little on when the Welshman received a lay-off from Defoe inside the centre-circle but he put on the after-burners to race to the edge of the Norwich area. Full-back Javier Garrido was then bamboozled with a mesmerising step-over before he stroked home with the outside of his boot. It was yet another stunning goal from a remarkable player. Buoyed by Bale's brilliance, Spurs pushed for the win that would aid their bid for Champions League qualification. The momentum was now with them and substitute Gylfi Sigurdsson saw his rasping shot superbly tipped round the post by Bunn to ensure a draw.  Norwich manager Chris Hughton:  "Until Spurs scored, I thought we were good value. They did cause us problems and had good possession and our goalkeeper Mark Bunn made a super save, but apart from that, they had limited good chances and we were always a threat. "We have a great support and it was important after Liverpool and Luton that we put on a performance. "We were better today, we have had some misfortune lately, but if we continue like this, we will be OK."  Tottenham manager Andre Villas-Boas:  "He [Gareth Bale] got lucky [in the build-up to his goal] that Alexander Tettey did not break his ankle when he was running to score, I think it was a yellow card or probably a red card to give. But moving on, it was a great goal, with such pace and power. "In the first half we were not as good as we can be, in the second half, we really put on a show to level the game. It was a pity as it was three points I think we wanted to win and move forward to profit in some way from the Arsenal and Liverpool game. "The boys recognised they were not themselves in the first half, so they showed great commitment in the second half to come out strongly. Their commitment was excellent and I think it should serve as an example for what we want to do moving forward."

24.04.2013 23:34:05 Newcastle United won the battle of the Premier League strugglers to deepen Aston Villa's misery and plunge them into the relegation places. Paul Lambert's side - knocked out of the Capital One Cup and FA Cup by lower league opposition in the last week - paid the price for a dreadful first-half performance that allowed Newcastle to take control. Papiss Cisse and Yohan Cabaye gave them a two-goal lead at half-time that proved too much for Villa to turn around, even with a vastly improved effort after the break. Christian Benteke's penalty just after half-time established the platform for a Villa rally, but Alan Pardew's side held out for their first league win since mid-December. Pardew will hope this win finally helps Newcastle find the sort of form that took them into the top five last season - but Villa are now deep in trouble and in desperate need of points and new faces to rejuvenate a side lacking confidence and inspiration. This latest defeat means Villa have lost their last three home games in the league to fellow strugglers Wigan Athletic, Southampton and Newcastle - completing a sequence of only two points from their last seven league games since winning at Liverpool. Villa owner Randy Lerner has issued a public message of support for Lambert, but a more constructive course of action might be to try to make a breakthrough in the transfer market before Thursday's deadline. Darren Bent was given a rare start alongside Benteke, but it was to prove another fruitless and frustrating evening for the England striker, who was removed after only 45 minutes. Pardew started with two of his new signings, Moussa Sissoko and Yoan Gouffran, and the injection of fresh impetus was in evidence as Newcastle dominated the opening half. Sissoko, in particular, was a major influence and produced a flash of creativity as Newcastle took the lead in the 19th minute. He split the centre of Villa's defence with precision and Cisse raced into the area to beat Brad Guzan with a clinical finish. The best Villa response was a thunderous rising drive from Charles N'Zogbia that rattled the woodwork with keeper Tim Krul well beaten - but it was a rare moment of encouragement in a desperate 45 minutes. And Newcastle doubled their lead just after the half-hour, Cabaye this time the scorer. He collected Ron Vlaar's poor headed clearance before sending a measured finish high past the stretching Guzan into the top corner. Villa's supporters responded angrily to the half-time whistle - and Lambert reacted by removing Bent and Joe Bennett to introduce Andreas Weimann and Gabriel Agbonlahor. The effect was instant, as Weimann brought a fine save from Krul and Agbonlahor was brought down by Mathieu Debuchy in the area. Newcastle clearly felt it was a harsh decision by referee Mike Dean, but he ignored their protests and Benteke sent Krul the wrong way with the resulting spot-kick. Krul then saved well from Weimann as the momentum shifted back towards Villa in a manner that seemed barely possible at half-time. Gouffran was replaced by Vurnon Anita, after a quiet debut, with 17 minutes left and Sissoko, who had faded after a fine start, was substituted by another new boy Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa six minutes later. Villa thought they had got the equaliser as the game entered its last 10 minutes, but a combination of Krul and Jonas Gutierrez swept away Nathan Baker's downward header. It was the last moment of real anxiety for Newcastle and the celebrations of their supporters at the final whistle illustrated the significance of this result.

24.04.2013 23:34:05 Bottom club Queens Park Rangers held Premier League champions Manchester City to a draw, thanks to a fantastic goalkeeping display from Julio Cesar. The visitors dominated the first half as Pablo Zabaleta hit the bar and Gareth Barry had a shot tipped wide. Rangers were a danger on the break, with Adel Taarabt and Loic Remy going close either side of half-time. QPR continued to stand firm in the second half, with Cesar denying David Silva from six yards. But a point was the very least Rangers deserved for a spirited defensive display as they stretched their unbeaten Premier League run in 2013. Since the turn of the year, Harry Redknapp's side have beaten Chelsea and held both Tottenham and West Ham - and this was another performance of real substance. City looked like overwhelming Rangers in a dominant first-half performance, but the hosts grew in confidence and stature as the game wore on and continue to offer their supporters hope they can win their battle against relegation. There was no Mario Balotelli for Manchester City, as the Italian striker finalises a move to AC Milan, and Roberto Mancini will be concerned that his side could not find a way past the club bottom of the league. They had their chances, with Joleon Lescott shooting over the bar after a rare mistake from Cesar and Zabaleta rattling the woodwork with a header from 12 yards after good work by Silva. Javi Garcia, playing at centre-half in place of the injured Vincent Kompany, also fired wide from 30 yards as City poured forward in the early stages. While City were dominant in midfield, Taarabt and Remy were a constant threat on the break. First, Remy capitalised on a quick free-kick to break clear and have a shot deflected wide, before Taarabt countered and forced a fantastic sprawling save from Joe Hart. Both chances came against the run of play and City looked like taking the lead when Carlos Tevez pulled the ball back for Barry - only for Cesar to tip the England midfielder's 18-yard shot wide. QPR were content for the visitors to dominate possession, often having all 11 men back behind the ball. The tactic began to bring reward as City struggled to unlock the Rangers defence, which was well marshalled by Ryan Nelsen on his final appearance for the club before leaving to take over as manager of Toronto FC. Aguero, who famously scored City's late winner when they won the Premier League title with victory over QPR on the final day of last season, was not as clinical and he blazed over from 12 yards. Edin Dzeko, so often City's saviour from the bench, was brought on and he looked like finally breaking Rangers' resistance when he pulled the ball back for Silva, but the Spanish playmaker saw his six-yard shot spectacularly saved by Cesar. Both sides had late penalty shouts, with Remy and Scott Sinclair going down in the area, but referee Phil Dowd waved away the appeals. And while Rangers were left delighted with another gutsy point at the final whistle, City were hoping Manchester United fail to capitalise and stretch their lead at the top of the table to seven points against Southampton on Wednesday.  QPR manager Harry Redknapp: "Of course it is a bonus point, it is a great point. "They rip teams to pieces home and away, you would take a point off them at any time. It is a fantastic result. "I wouldn't say it is the end (of the title race) - it is a good result for Fergie (Sir Alex Ferguson) tonight for sure, but it is still open."  Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini: "We lost two points, this is sure. We played well, we had the chances but didn't score - that is all it is. "We are disappointed with this result because we had a lot of chances to win, we dominated this game but when you play like this and don't score quickly it can be difficult. "QPR defended very well and got players behind the ball and Julio Cesar was incredible tonight."

24.04.2013 23:34:05 Wigan fought back from two goals down to rescue a point at Stoke and move out of the Premier League relegation zone. Ryan Shawcross's close-range volley gave Stoke the lead, and Peter Crouch poked in a second after Ali Al-Habsi spilled Charlie Adam's shot. But Wigan hit back, as James McArthur fired in off the post and Franco Di Santo swept in from McArthur's knock-down to equalise. Stoke were on the back foot from then on, but held on for the draw. For 50 minutes any result other than a home win looked unlikely, but Wigan manager Roberto Martinez will no doubt be heartened by his side's fightback. There was a lengthy delay early in the game while Robert Huth had his head bandaged following a clash with Di Santo, but Stoke were soon on the attack. Jon Walters's shot from 30 yards drew ironic cheers from away fans as it flew well wide of goal, and Adam's low effort from outside the area was just beyond the left upright. But the home side were deservedly ahead after 23 minutes, even though the goal came in somewhat fortuitous circumstances. Adam sent a free-kick towards the back post where Jean Beausejour's attempted headed clearance smacked into the back of James McCarthy's head and rebounded into the path of Shawcross, who scored from close range. Wigan almost responded immediately as Shaun Maloney showed great trickery to get the better of Geoff Cameron, but his teasing cross for James McArthur was cleared. Stoke also escaped just before the break when Beausejour crossed for McArthur but the ball came in with too much pace and the midfielder's volley flashed wide. Despite the Latics' occasional bright moments, the hosts generally looked comfortable and the second goal they sought arrived three minutes into the second half. Adam set off on a driving run towards the Wigan area and, with defenders backing off, drilled a low effort that Al-Habsi could only push into the path of Crouch, who sidefooted in from close range. Stoke had barely finished celebrating, however, when Wigan halved the deficit. Roger Espinoza fed a pass between two defenders and the impressive McArthur raced through before hitting a shot with the outside of his boot that clipped the post on its way in. The balance of play was now firmly in Wigan's favour and they produced attack after attack. And they equalised just after the hour when Espinoza clipped the ball towards the back of the area for McArthur, who headed across the face of goal for Di Santo to sweep in from six yards. The visitors went in pursuit of a third and Stoke keeper Asmir Begovic had to dive at full stretch to keep out a testing effort from the lively McArthur, while the Bosnian was again on hand to deny Shaun Maloney's curled effort. Maloney's teasing cross behind the defence was poked narrowly wide by Di Santo in stoppage time, but the hosts survived to take a point they just about deserved.  Stoke manager Tony Pulis: "I am disappointed with the goals we conceded. It should never have happened. The people should stay with their runners. "First half we were OK, we pressed and had the impetus, but after scoring the second goal you think you are going to win it. "I couldn't see us getting beaten after we went 2-0 up, but we haven't beaten Wigan since 2009 and they seem to be a bit of  bogey team for us."  Wigan manager Robert Martinez: "I am very proud of the players' performance. Going two down at one of the toughest places to go and the way we imposed ourselves was a credit for the team. "We dropped two points and the truth is we can't give two points away. We are looking at the points left to play for and we want to get as many as we can. "We shouldn't have conceded two goals but I couldn't be prouder of our performance in the second half."

24.04.2013 23:34:05 Sunderland and Swansea shared the points in a Premier League game short of excitement. The visitors were the livelier side in the first half and had an early penalty appeal when Itay Shechter went down under pressure from John O'Shea. Chico Flores almost scored at the near post but Simon Mignolet made an excellent reaction save low down. The Swans should have snatched victory late on but Nathan Dyer shanked his shot wide from 10 yards. If there was a suspicion the Welsh side might have their minds elsewhere after their League Cup heroics against Chelsea, there was little to vindicate it in an opening 45 minutes that Michael Laudrup's men dominated. Sunderland - on a run of five wins in eight games - could not get the ball off the visitors, although the Swans' slick interchange passing regularly broke down against a Black Cats defence that had kept three clean sheets in their previous four home games. The Swans had an early penalty shout when Shechter went over in a tackle with O'Shea, replays suggesting he was caught slightly, but referee Andre Marriner turned down his appeal. Their best chance came when defender Chico Flores finally found some space in the box but his shot on the turn was palmed away by Mignolet low at his near post. Swans top scorer Michu struggled to find a sight of goal while Flores and Jonathan de Guzman shot wildly off-target from long range. Sunderland finally woke up at the start of the second half but not to the extent that they troubled Swansea keeper Gerhard Tremmel. And as the half wore on, it was the visitors who looked the more likely to snatch a winner. Dyer went close with 10 minutes to go when Michu pulled the ball back into the winger's path but he blasted wide. And substitute Danny Graham, a reported Sunderland target before Thursday's transfer deadline, could have stolen all three points in injury time. Michu cleverly headed the ball down to him but Titus Bramble made a last-ditch tackle to block Graham's strike.  Sunderland manager Martin O'Neill:  "It was really disappointing. We didn't create enough, we didn't exert enough pressure and we allowed them to dictate the pattern of the game. "We're the home side and should do better. "They came here with confidence after reaching the Capital One Cup final. That said, we won the last couple of games and played well last time we were here."  Swansea manager Michael Laudrup:  "After all that happened against Chelsea, going to the final, everyone in Swansea is talking about going to that final. No-one had spoken about Sunderland. "It was very important for me to see how they reacted to that and I'm very pleased. "First half we completely dominated, in an away game, against a good side. Clean sheet, a very good performance - that's great for me to say."

24.04.2013 23:34:05 Arsenal produced a scintillating attacking display to record a first league win of 2013 in emphatic fashion with victory against West Ham. But an entertaining game was marred by an injury to West Ham's Dan Potts. Jack Collison volleyed West Ham ahead but Lukas Podolski equalised from distance as Arsenal took control. Olivier Giroud poked in and Santi Cazorla's back-heel made it 3-1. Theo Walcott then fired in from a counter before Giroud side-footed home. There was concern for West Ham towards the end of the second half when 18-year-old substitute Potts needed lengthy treatment on the pitch before he was carried off on a stretcher. Arsenal remain sixth but cut the gap on fourth-place Tottenham to four points, while West Ham are 12th. Back in April 2007, West Ham became the first side to beat Arsenal at Emirates Stadium when a solitary Bobby Zamora strike gave them a 1-0 victory.  For a brief spell, it looked as though a repeat of that scoreline might have been on the cards when the Hammers took an 18th-minute lead courtesy of a fine strike by Collison. A corner was only cleared as far as the edge of the Arsenal area where Collison charged in to smash a half-volley beyond a stranded Wojciech Szczesny. Barely four minutes later an equally stunning strike from Podolski drew Arsenal level as Jack Wilshere found the German in space around 25 yards from goal and he drove the ball into the bottom-right corner of Jussi Jaaskelainen's goal. Play continued to swing from one end to the other after that and a tremendous burst of pace from Walcott should have brought Arsenal's second, but his cross was cleared by James Tomkins. Arsenal were piling on the pressure and had another great opportunity midway through the half when a lovely move ended with Podolski prodding a shot towards goal but Joey O'Brien was well placed to clear off the line. Aaron Ramsey then did likewise at the other end of the pitch when the Welshman lashed Carlton Cole's goalbound effort away to safety after the West Ham striker had peeled away from the Arsenal defence. Barely two minutes into the second half and Arsenal were ahead. Walcott sent a corner towards the near post and Giroud ghosted in to stab a volley into the net. From then on Arsenal were rampant and for the next 10 minutes almost every attack resulted in a goal. First, Giroud and Podolski combined to set up Cazorla, who cheekily back-heeled the ball beyond Jaaskelainen and just one minute later Walcott was picked out at the far post by Podoloski's low cross and he rifled the ball home. A stunned West Ham conceded a fifth just before the hour when Giroud poked in from Podolski's ball. Much to West Ham's undoubted relief, the pace of the game settled down after that, although Arsenal often looked capable of adding another goal whenever they attacked. There was a break in play midway through the second half when Potts took a heavy knock and needed treatment for 10 minutes before he was stretched off the pitch. By that stage, West Ham had used all their substitutes, meaning they had to play the remainder of the match with 10 men. Due to the earlier injury to Potts, 12 minutes of injury time were needed after the 90 minutes were up and unsurprisingly Arsenal dominated with the man advantage. Substitute Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain saw a shot blocked, before Cazorla's effort was tipped wide by Jaaskelainen, but no further goals were forthcoming before the final whistle.  Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said: "West Ham defended very well in the first half, we looked dangerous but couldn't finish our chances. We came out in the second half and attacked with tremendous pace. The injury to Dan Potts was the end of the game really but until that moment we played very well. "In the Chelsea game there were a lot of positives, it was disappointing to lose, but we took the positives and transferred that into to this game. "You want to be at your best every single game but we have many new players and it takes some time to get to know each other very well and I think that understanding is getting better."  West Ham manager Sam Allardyce said: "It was 10 minutes of genius. "We could say we could defend better but I thought they hit the ground running. "The encouraging thing for them was that we switched off for one corner and that lifted them. In the first half we defended exceptionally well but that 10 minutes blew us away."

24.04.2013 23:34:05 Mauricio Pochettino's Southampton managerial career got off to a promising start as an entertaining game with Everton ended goalless. Pochettino was greeted by warm applause when he took his place in the dugout, and fans will have been happy with his side's first-half display. Rickie Lambert hit the post before he saw a header cleared off the line. The visitors improved after the break as Nikica Jelavic mis-hit a shot before Victor Anichebe's drive was saved. The home side finished strongly and though they could not find a winner, it was ultimately a well-earned point after recent events at the club. Much of the focus in the build-up to the game was understandably on Pochettino, who was named Southampton manager on Friday following the surprise sacking of Nigel Adkins.  A throng of photographers had their cameras pointed at the Southampton technical area prior to kick-off as they awaited his arrival, and when the former Espanyol coach did emerge from the tunnel there was a ripple of applause from the home fans within the vicinity of the dugout. Adkins's contribution to the club was recognised by fans though, as a chant of 'only one Nigel Adkins' rang out as the game got under way, but aside from that there was little in the way of protests. Despite the potentially unsettling events of the last few days, Southampton started brightly as Phil Jagielka almost diverted Lambert's low cross into his own net, before Jason Puncheon's drive from a dangerous position deflected off Jagielka. It took Everton 15 minutes to get themselves going but even when they did, they did not trouble Artur Boruc in the Southampton goal as Jelavic headed tamely wide from Marouane Fellaini's ball, before Leighton Baines saw a shot blocked. Instead it was Saints who continued to look the most likely to score and only the woodwork denied them the lead in the 20th minute as Lambert's curled free-kick bounced back off the left upright. Minutes later the lively Lambert had another chance as he raced into the area, cut the ball back onto his left foot before trying to bend a shot beyond Tim Howard, but the Everton keeper parried the effort away. Lambert went even closer midway through the half as his header from a corner was cleared off the line by Jelavic before Jos Hooiveld volleyed straight at Howard from the ensuing mix-up in the area. As impressive as Southampton had been there was always the fear that they would be made to rue missed chances and that was almost the case six minutes into the second half with Fellaini twice going close. The Belgian midfielder first saw a close-range shot denied by the feet of Boruc and then directed a header straight at the Southampton keeper. Anichebe was introduced soon after and the striker's pace soon started to cause the home side defensive problems. Everton should have been ahead on the hour when Anichebe's well-timed run punched through the Southampton backline and he squared a pass for the unmarked Jelavic inside the area, but the Croatian completely missed his kick and a grateful defence cleared. Boruc did well to push away a powerful drive from Anichebe as Everton continued to press but Southampton survived, soaking up the pressure before finishing strongly. Lambert planted a header on the roof of Howard's net but in the end a draw was a probably a fair result.  Everton manager David Moyes said: "We got better after we had a word at half-time. The chance for Jelavic was a real big chance, we are a little bit like that at the moment. "This time last year we were stealing the goals but it will come. Kevin Mirallas and Victor Anichebe made an impact for us and a draw here is not a bad result. "We are in a good position and we have as much chance of anyone of getting that fourth spot."

24.04.2013 23:34:05 John Terry scored twice following a stunning David Luiz strike as Chelsea beat Fulham to move above Arsenal into third place in the Premier League. Fulham could have gone ahead early on but Bryan Ruiz fired a volley over from five yards, before Petr Cech saved Urbi Emanuelson's shot. Luiz then crowned his 100th Chelsea appearance by smashing a 35-yard shot past Mark Schwarzer after 30 minutes. Terry stole in to score back-post headers either side of half-time. The Chelsea skipper, back in the side after being omitted from the FA Cup semi-final defeat by Manchester City on Sunday, made a triumphant return to keep Chelsea's Champions League qualification ambitions on track. Rafael Benitez's side are now a point above the Gunners with a game in hand as their Spanish interim manager prepares to take the Blues to his former club Liverpool on Sunday. The victory, which ended a run of three Premier League defeats away from home, came thanks to a clinical finishing display that put the game out of Fulham's reach before the interval. In keeping with a run of one defeat in their last seven Premier League games, Martin Jol's side were in the ascendancy early on but they once again fell to defeat by their west London neighbours, extending a remarkable run of just one win in 33 years. Had Ruiz scored from Sascha Riether's right-wing cross or John Arne Riise injected more power into his shot halfway through the first half, the picture might have more closely reflected the game's flow. However, it was Chelsea who took the lead, and in spectacular style as Luiz collected Eden Hazard's square ball and fired a stunning drive into the top corner. Fulham almost replied instantly when Emanuelson cut in from the left and his effort was superbly tipped around the post by Cech. Dimitar Berbatov was then narrowly off target with another strike. The hosts soon paid the price as Chelsea went further ahead two minutes before the break. Frank Lampard, aiming to take a step closer to Bobby Tambling's record of 202 goals for Chelsea on his 600th appearance, fired in a swerving free-kick that Schwarzer chose to save with his chest. The resulting corner was initially cleared, but Juan Mata crossed to the back post where Terry thumped his header in. Fulham's first-half woe was summed up by a booking for Ruiz, who stumbled under close attention from Terry and was booked for diving by referee Mike Dean. Chelsea began the second half knocking the ball about with the confidence of a side with a two-goal cushion and Mata was inches away from making it three when he failed to reach Torres' cross. At the other end, in a sign that it was not to be Fulham's night, Mladen Petric managed to divert team-mate Philippe Senderos's goalbound header over the bar while standing on the line. Minutes later, Terry grabbed his second from another corner to put the game out of sight, nodding in at the back post after he was found by Torres' near-post header.  Fulham boss Martin Jol on Bryan Ruiz's booking for diving:  "If that is a dive, it's ridiculous, he lost his balance. Of course a player can lose his balance and fall down but it's never a booking. The only thing I said [to the referee] was that is why I can see you never played and I think he agreed. "We couldn't get the goal we should have had in the first few minutes; Dimitar Berbatov had a few shots, Urby Emanuelson, Giorgos Karagounis and Mladen Petric had chances, but we didn't get the break and then it's always difficult. And then 3-0 if you didn't see the game, it was a bit harsh."  Chelsea boss Rafael Benitez on David Luiz's goal:  "I have seen him in training sessions scoring lots of goals and free kicks so he has the ability and the quality, he's very good player. "Obviously to win is very important, to win with a clean sheet and scoring three goals is more important and to win a derby is even more important, so there are lots of positives. "You talk about other teams [challenging for the Champions League], they have also players with experience. The main thing is to concentrate and use the quality that we have and stick together as a team. Everybody knows we have to be ready for every game, change players - they have to be ready because we still have two games a week."

24.04.2013 23:34:05 Clint Dempsey scored a late equaliser for Tottenham to deny Manchester United victory at White Hart Lane. The Spurs forward scrambled the ball over the line in time added on, to leave Sir Alex Ferguson's side only five points ahead of Manchester City at the top of the Premier League table. Robin van Persie had headed in his 22nd goal of the season midway through the first half to put United in control. Spurs improved but were relieved to see Wayne Rooney's penalty claim denied. Spurs manager Andre Villas-Boas's clenched fist said it all at the final whistle. It was a reaction every bit as defiant as the performance of his players. United have built a reputation for scoring late, but on this occasion it was Ferguson who was left to swallow the most bitter of pills. For 92 minutes, United had looked on course to restore their seven-point lead at the top of the table. With Phil Jones, Michael Carrick and Tom Cleverley driving them forward, they been controlled and efficient, rather than electrifying. Snow fell throughout, the pitch having been passed fit for play an hour before kick-off, but just when United thought they had weathered the conditions and Tottenham's second-half storm, Dempsey struck. For most of the game, Van Persie's brilliance had once again looked as if it would gloss over any United weaknesses, with the solidity of Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic at the heart of the defence equally impressive. United goalkeeper David De Gea also shone, keeping his side in the game time and again during a second-half bombardment, only to fail to punch clear in the lead-up to Tottenham's equaliser. And yet, despite that goal, United have more points after 23 games than all but one team in Premier League history. They remain firmly in control. White Hart Lane had been curiously subdued for much of the opening 25 minutes when Van Persie sparked the contest in life. The goal came after a patient build-up that gathered pace when Danny Welbeck found Cleverley in an advanced position on the right-hand side. His cross, whipped into the penalty area, was a good one, but Van Persie made it look even better, pulling away from Kyle Walker to head the ball forcefully beyond Lloris at his near post for his 10th goal in as many league games. Tottenham were looking for their first double over United since the 1989-90 season but, with Gareth Bale struggling to impose his authority on a midfield in which United scrapped for everything, the first half flickered, rather than blazed. Much of that was down to United's insatiable work-rate, with their players often doubling up on Tottenham's main threat - in Rafael and Phil Jones, Bale found he had unwelcome, unstinting company. With half-time approaching, a loose ball broke for Bale on the edge of the penalty area and he was on to it in a flash, letting fly with his right foot. The ball flicked off Ferdinand but, despite being wrong-footed by the deflection, De Gea made the save with an outstretched left leg. The Spaniard was required to make another early in the second half to deny Dempsey from six yards with the goal apparently at his mercy and saved United again by tipping another goal-bound effort from the American just round his right-hand post. With Spurs growing as an attacking threat, Ferguson responded by introducing Rooney, who almost made an immediate impression. The England striker went down in the penalty area, having been clipped by Steven Caulker only to see referee Chris Foy wave away United's claims. Still Spurs continued to pour forward - Lennon zipped away from Patrice Evra and freed Defoe in the penalty area but at the crucial moment the England striker hesitated, allowing Ferdinand to appear from nowhere to snuff out the danger. But with time running out, Spurs finally broke through. De Gea failed to punch Benoit Assou-Ekotto's cross clear, allowing Lennon to cross for Dempsey to prod home.  Tottenham manager Andre Villas-Boas: "We dominated the whole game, played well and deserved to win. We had 60% possession against United, 15 shots against four and should have won. Champions like United have to go through moments like this but I think we deserved this last-minute goal. "We set our targets high, we wanted to win. We understood you are not going to go two or three up but we managed to get at least a point and a deserved point."  Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand: "Before the game we would have taken a point. We have a good record here over the years, but Spurs have improved so we would have taken a point, but we are disappointed. We defended well as a team. "When you play against a team with Gareth Bale in it you have to set yourself up right. We didn't do that at Old Trafford - we were not going to make the same mistake again. They are a team who are improving under a new manager, so we leave here not too down."

24.04.2013 23:34:05 Chelsea held off London rivals Arsenal at Stamford Bridge to claim their first home win of 2013 at the fourth attempt. Juan Mata drove in a shot to put the Blues in front, although the visitors could justifiably claim there had been a foul against them in the build-up. Keeper Wojciech Szczesny brought down Ramires and Frank Lampard scored from the spot for Chelsea's second. Forward Theo Walcott's clinical sidefoot finish gave the Gunners hope but the hosts held on for the win. Chelsea had let a two-goal lead slip on Wednesday as they drew against Southampton and, when Demba Ba missed an excellent chance for them late on, it only added to their worries of a repeat here. They also had to endure five minutes of added time in which centre-back Gary Cahill produced a vital interception and Gunners forward Olivier Giroud headed just over. It was only a second top-flight win in six at Stamford Bridge under interim Blues manager Rafael Benitez, who had the rare experience of Chelsea fans not booing him at the final whistle. Arsenal had been overwhelmed in the first half and when manager Arsene Wenger sent them out early for the second half, it was easy to imagine what the Frenchman's half-time mood had been. The Gunners had enjoyed the first real chance of the game but they were soon overrun at a snowy Stamford Bridge. Walcott, fresh from signing a new contract, slipped a pass to Giroud, whose left-foot strike went narrowly wide. The miss was immediately punished. Mata beautifully took down a diagonal Cesar Azpilicueta pass and shot high into the net past keeper Szczesny. On the touchline, Wenger was enraged his side had not been awarded a free-kick for a Ramires challenge on Francis Coquelin in the build-up. The visitors almost responded with Santi Cazorla having a 25-yard shot palmed wide by keeper Petr Cech before Chelsea smothered Arsenal with the pace, power and panache of their play. Eden Hazard mesmerised the visiting defence with a jinking run and saw his angled shot saved before Chelsea extended their lead. Ramires was found unmarked on the right side of Arsenal's defence and, as Szczesny came out to make a spread-eagled save, the Chelsea midfielder went over the keeper's leg to earn a penalty. Szczesny escaped a red card but Lampard scored from the spot for his 195th Chelsea goal, which puts him just seven behind the club's record goalscorer Bobby Tambling. The only downside to Chelsea's performance was the sight of striker Fernando Torres continuing to toil in front of goal, slicing one shot horribly wide just before the break. After the interval, the Gunners began to look a threat at last. Centre-back Per Mertesacker and striker Walcott had efforts on goal, both shooting straight at Cech, while Giroud mistimed a header before the visitors pulled a goal back. Cazorla pierced Chelsea's defence with a pass into the run of Walcott, who controlled the ball and eased a shot from just inside the area past Cech for his ninth league goal of the season. The Blues were playing more like the away team as they threatened on the counter-attack and Torres broke clear only for a heavy touch to allow Szczesny to save. Ba was also played through and, after rounding the Arsenal keeper on the edge of area, he seemed bound to score only for Thomas Vermaelen to block his shot. The Senegal striker must have been relieved his miss was not punished by the visitors, and he had Cahill to thank for blocking a pass that would have put Walcott in late on. But Giroud's missed header proved Arsenal's last chance as they fell to their second away defeat of the season and seven points off a top four spot.  Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger:  "We gave them too much room in which to play in the first half. We had the first chance, a fantastic chance, but missed it. "I thought Francis Coquelin was injured for the first [Chelsea goal], and I'm not convinced at all that it was a penalty on the second one. "We made some changes at half-time and came out with a different attitude with much more initiative. We had Chelsea on the back foot but could not get it back to 2-2. We didn't make enough of our corners and free-kicks."

24.04.2013 23:34:06 Peter Odemwingie scored a dramatic 83rd-minute equaliser as West Bromwich Albion came from 2-0 down to deny struggling Aston Villa a crucial win. Christian Benteke's turn and shot from outside the penalty area put Villa ahead before Gabriel Agbonlahor doubled the lead with a composed finish. But Chris Brunt's 20-yard effort sparked a fine Baggies fightback. Odemwingie levelled from inside the six-yard area after Villa failed to clear a corner. Although a point was enough to lift the visitors out of the relegation zone, it was a familiar story for Paul Lambert and his players. Not for the first time this season Villa failed to secure three points after leading 2-0, and they remain in trouble near the bottom of the table. In an absorbing West Midlands derby, they raced into a two-goal lead on the back of a gutsy performance full of youthful exuberance against a West Brom side that struggled to get going until the second half. Benteke opened the scoring with a glorious 12th-minute finish, the Belgian producing a superb turn and strike from outside the area after Albion's defence had backed off. West Brom were a shadow of the side that started the season so well, and fell further behind when Agbonlahor drilled a left-foot finish beyond Ben Foster after turning inside Gareth McAuley. Then Baggies keeper Foster produced arguably the turning point of the match when he denied substitute Eric Lichaj, a fifth-minute replacement for injured defender Nathan Baker, from making it 3-0 before half-time. Brunt's 49th-minute side-foot finish in off the post from 20 yards began Albion's comeback, Odemwingie twice going close to scoring before rescuing a point with seven minutes remaining. The striker, who was not called up by Nigeria for the Africa Cup of Nations, capped an excellent second-half display after turning inside the six-yard box to hammer the ball into the roof of the net following a header by McAuley from a corner. The result at least stopped the rot for Villa after four defeats in their previous six league games. Yet they are without a win in six matches and face two important ties against Bradford in the Capital One Cup semi-final and Millwall in the FA Cup before returning to league action against fellow strugglers Newcastle on 29 January. But Lambert's side face a battle to stay up until they learn to see out games.  West Bromwich Albion manager Steve Clarke:  "We had a chance to regroup at a half-time. We knew the third goal would be crucial in the game and it came to us. "We then had the momentum to get back in the game. At the end we were the team on the front foot and chasing the win. "Villa were dangerous on the counter-attack, but if we're being honest the first half performance wasn't good enough and we should be happy with a point."  Aston Villa manager Paul Lambert:  "We should have been four up. Some of the football we played was excellent. We gave that game a right good go, but we should have been out of sight in the first half. "My players have taken a lot of knocks, but I have nothing but praise for them. They give me everything they've got. And the fans are right behind us. "But you have to give West Brom credit. They haven't lost many games at home."

24.04.2013 23:34:06 Liverpool strikers Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge started together for the first time and both scored as the Reds thrashed Norwich at Anfield. A classy Jordan Henderson strike put Liverpool in front and a Sturridge dummy let Suarez confidently slot in. Grant Holt had a rare Norwich effort saved before Sturridge tapped in a Stewart Downing cross and Steven Gerrard rifled in a 25-yard strike. Ryan Bennett put Raheem Sterling's cross into his own net for the fifth. Sturridge's goal meant he became the first player since Ray Kennedy in 1974 to score in each of his first three games for Liverpool and the ovation he was given when substituted showed he has quickly won over fans of the Merseyside club. There was a degree of apprehension that the 23-year-old's arrival might diminish the impact of Suarez but so far those fears appear unfounded. Instead, the duo provided evidence they could form a prolific partnership as Liverpool put in an assured display for a sixth win in their last eight league games at home. Norwich's containment strategy did not work and, with just one point from the last 18, they will be wary of being sucked back into the relegation battle. The Canaries presented the Reds with a yellow wall to break down and the home side initially struggled to find a way through. The visitors could even have shocked their hosts, only for central defender Ryan Bennett to nod a free far-post header straight at keeper Brad Jones. Sturridge and Suarez combined and the former had a shot saved before Henderson provided the flash of inspiration Liverpool needed to take the lead. The ball broke into the midfielder's path after Suarez was tackled on the edge of the area and Henderson produced an unerring 18-yard strike. From there on, Liverpool never looked back. Norwich continued to sit back and invite pressure and were soon punished again when Suarez, who had scored two hat-tricks in his last two games against the Canaries, struck. Sturridge dummied a pass from Lucas Leiva to send the Uruguayan in on the visitors' goal and Suarez slotted into the bottom corner for his 20th goal of the season. Norwich produced little in attack, Holt having a follow-up shot from the right of the area blocked by home keeper Jones, after seeing his initial header cleared. That was almost the last meaningful action from Jones, playing in place of the injured Pepe Reina, such was Liverpool's dominance. Sturridge stole in at the far post to mark his Anfield bow with a simple finish after Downing's low first-time cross before Gerrard sent a low, long-range strike into the bottom corner. Liverpool had scored five against Norwich in the reverse fixture in September and repeated the trick when substitute Sterling's cross was put into his own net by centre-back Bennett.  Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers:  "It was an outstanding team performance. The first goal was going to be important and Jordan scored a fantastic goal. We've had games where we haven't got the first goal early enough and have ended up drawing. "It [Daniel Sturridge's goal] was the type of goal he was brought in for. He is terrific outside the box but he is a real killer in it. It's three goals in three games for him and I think there will be many to come. We have played well for most of the season but Daniel coming in adds that extra threat. He has pace and power and he has got good touch and good skills. "We are just taking each game as it comes. It is a very pleasing day but we will not get too far ahead of ourselves."  Norwich manager Chris Hughton:  "What we were up against today was an extremely good Liverpool side. They were very good and clinical. "It's been a bad day for us and we need to dust ourselves down and make sure we are better for the next game. "We need to get back on track. Sometimes you have to accept that, with the quality these teams have, if you have a bad day you can be well beaten."

24.04.2013 23:34:06 David Silva scored twice as Manchester City saw off Fulham to close the gap on leaders Manchester United to four points, for 24 hours at least. United can restore their seven-point advantage when they go to Tottenham on Sunday but City succeeded in their mission of putting pressure on their title rivals before their tough test in north London. This was a straightforward enough victory for the champions, rather than the scintillating one it threatened to be when Silva put his side ahead after just 95 seconds, but the three points were what mattered for Roberto Mancini's men. Fulham rarely posed a serious threat other than when Steve Sidwell headed against the post in the first half but City did not make the points safe until Silva struck his second in the 69th minute. The Cottagers' form - two wins in their last 14 games - had suggested an easy afternoon for the hosts, who certainly made the perfect start. They opened the scoring after James Milner darted in to win possession, allowing Edin Dzeko to fire in a 25-yard shot that Mark Schwarzer could only parry into the path of Silva. Martin Jol's side are not known for their resistance, especially on the road, but against expectations they dug in after going behind. With City bogged down in midfield, and careless in possession, the Cottagers began to venture forward and fired a succession of crosses into Joe Hart's area. The home side were still threatening and had glimpses of goal when Dzeko and Carlos Tevez both brought routine saves out of Schwarzer. But Fulham came within inches of levelling when Damien Duff's cross was met by Sidwell, who was under pressure from Pablo Zabaleta but still managed to send the ball looping against the outside of the woodwork. On the touchline, Mancini's frustration was obvious, and the home fans were also becoming exasperated by City's wasteful play. City badly needed a second goal but continued to give the ball away in promising positions, although Dzeko did go close before half-time with a whipped shot from Tevez's pull-back. Things improved in the second half, with the hard-working Tevez firing over and Kompany going close with a header from a corner. Fulham were by this stage offering little at the other end but still retained hope of snatching a point until Silva made sure of his side's victory. The Spanish playmaker started the move that led to the goal, and finished it too - running on to Tevez's clever dummy from Gael Clichy's pass to dink the ball over Schwarzer. He should have completed his hat-trick moments later when Tevez sent him running clear, but this time he rolled his shot wide. Even so, there was no way back for Fulham, and City could afford to miss more chances before the end - most notably a howler from Dzeko, who lifted the ball over the bar from six yards out.  Man City assistant manager David Platt: "I thought our performance in the second half got much better. I thought we defended well as a team, but in the second half we started to create more opportunities to score. "David Silva had a great time last season and his recent performances have been very good. He does great things for us, but he has missed the goals his performances deserve. He got two today, and should have had three. "Towards the end we could have got three or four, and a clean sheet is great."  Fulham boss Martin Jol: "We made plans and train to do whatever we want, but to concede in the second minute is a horrific scenario. At 1-0 down it could have been a horrible day. "After they scored we did better, but the final ball wasn't great. If you want something here at Man City you need a bit of luck and quality, but we couldn't find that special moment. That was disappointing. "We could have hurt them because they didn't score their second until the 70th minute and this wasn't Man City at their best."

24.04.2013 23:34:06 Adam Le Fondre came off the bench to score twice in six minutes as Reading completed a superb turnaround to beat struggling Newcastle. The hosts were well on top and took a first-half lead when the impressive Yohan Cabaye curled in a free-kick. But after Pavel Pogrebnyak went close, Le Fondre scored with his first touch, turning in Jimmy Kebe's low cross. And he earned Reading's first away win of the season when he gathered Kebe's nod-down to steer past Tim Krul. The comeback was reminiscent of Reading's incredible effort against West Brom last Saturday when they came from 2-0 down to win 3-2 with Le Fondre also playing a key part. Their first victory at Newcastle boosted the Premier League survival chances of Brian McDermott's side, leaving the Magpies without a win in six games. Just two points now separate the teams and, as much as the three points will encourage the Royals, it will also depress a Newcastle side who were on top for large parts of this match. Much of that was down to Cabaye, making his first start for Newcastle since 11 November, during which time Alan Pardew's side have won twice in 11 Premier League games. But Reading capitalised as he tired, and was eventually withdrawn to boos from the home supporters, to win for the third time in four league games. Cabaye's passing and well timed breaks forward had the Reading midfield turning from the start and it kept the visitors' defence busy too. After testing Federici from long distance, the France midfielder delightfully picked out Papiss Cisse with a flighted diagonal pass but the Australian keeper clawed away the striker's header. Cisse had two further efforts but again Federici did exceptionally to keep them out. Reading were willing to let Newcastle dominate possession and break on the counter and they almost took the lead when a sweeping move ended in Pogrebnyak sliding the ball wide from 12 yards from Garath McCleary's cross. Despite Newcastle's probing, Reading were proving tough to break down but that changed when Cabaye carved them open to take the lead. It was his pass that led to the free-kick, from which he stepped up to nonchalantly curl the ball over the wall and beyond Federici. Reading have struggled away from home all season but were inches from equalising via a Jonas Gutierrez own goal shortly after the interval when Ian Harte's free-kick clipped the Argentine's knee and fizzed past the far post. With snow showers continuing at St James' Park, the visitors did not look like scoring until Le Fondre, so often a threat from the bench in Reading's promotion push last season, was introduced. The substitute was on the field for less than a minute before he bundled home Kebe's low right-wing cross as the ball bounced off his chest. Le Fondre did not know much about it as he slid in after Mike Williamson missed the ball, but it was his ninth goal of the season and he reached double figures six minutes later. This time Jobi McAnuff crossed from the left, Kebe nodded it back and although debutant Hope Akpan miscued, it fell to former Rotherham striker Le Fondre, who squeezed the ball past Krul at the near post. Newcastle struggled to respond and their second half was summed up when Cisse beat the offside trap to fire horribly over from 10 yards.  Reading boss Brian McDermott: "We've looked at our away record and we've been in games, we've learned that you have to try and manage games at this level. We went to 4-4-2 to try and win the game, and I felt at 1-1 we had a major chance of doing it. "But when you have Adam Le Fondre coming off the bench like that, the second goal was top-drawer finish. A couple of years ago he was playing for Rotherham and what he is doing now for us, I'm just so proud of him."

24.04.2013 23:34:06 Two strikes from Jonathan de Guzman and Ben Davies's first goal saw Swansea secure a comprehensive win over Stoke. After a goalless first half Davies broke the deadlock when he fired a low shot past Asmir Begovic. De Guzman doubled the lead with a curling free-kick before completing a fine Swans move with an accomplished finish to make it three. Michael Owen's late header, his first goal for Stoke, was a mere consolation for the visitors. Stoke offered very little but the win will give Swansea confidence for their Capital One Cup semi-final second leg against Chelsea on Wednesday. The Swans made a probing start to the game with Michu firing high and wide after being teed up by Itay Shechter, who capitalised on a mistake by Robert Huth. Stoke found it hard to break out of their own half during the early exchanges but gradually improved. Despite their promising start the home side did not trouble Asmir Begovic, with Ki's long-range effort clearing the crossbar. In reply Peter Crouch, making his first league start since November, volleyed over the bar. Matthew Etherington found himself in the area after playing a neat one-two with Charlie Adam but the winger fired into the side-netting. Swansea upped their game as Pablo Hernandez and Davies saw efforts deflected, and Ki turned an effort wide of the post. The best move of what had been a forgettable first half saw Michu head wide from six yards following Angel Rangel's neat cross from the right. And De Guzman missed another excellent opportunity when he fluffed his shot after Wayne Routledge's cross found him in a packed penalty area. De Guzman again had his sights on goal early in the second half but the Dutchman blazed his effort over the bar. But two minutes later Swansea finally broke the deadlock courtesy of a first senior goal for 19-year-old full-back Davies. The Wales international showed strength and composure as he beat two players before coolly slotting the ball past Begovic. Michael Laudrup's side were now fully in control and when Michu was brought down on the edge of the area by Adam, De Guzman curled the free-kick into the net, beyond a stranded Begovic. New Swans loan signing Roland Lamah was introduced as a  replacement for Hernandez while Stoke's Kenwyne Jones, a possible Swansea target, replaced Crouch. Another substitute, Cameron Jerome missed a golden chance to reduce the deficit when he put the ball over from a yard out. The hosts completed the win when De Guzman finished off a sweeping move with an accomplished finish 10 minutes from time after receiving a pass from Danny Graham. Owen scored with a header from six yards for his first goal in Stoke colours but it was too late to prevent the Swans moving four points clear of their visitors and into eighth place in the Premier League.  Swansea City manager Michael Laudrup:  "We dominated from the first minute. In the first half Stoke had to defend very deep and the only bad point was we did not score from the two or three good chances we had. "In the second half we continued, but I knew we needed something special to score the first goal. If we scored the first goal I was sure we would win."  Stoke City manager Tony Pulis:  "We were second best from the first whistle to the last. Swansea were better and deserved to win. I've got no excuses. "You have good and bad days in football and this was a bad day for us. We looked a yard short all over the pitch. We looked sluggish and sloppy. "Whether it's the fact we played [Crystal] Palace in extra-time [in the FA Cup] and had to travel down early and had not been able to do anything for two days because of the snow, I don't know. But it wasn't us today."

24.04.2013 23:34:06 Loic Remy scored on his Queens Park Rangers debut but Joe Cole's second-half strike denied Harry Redknapp a victory at former club West Ham. The Â£8m striker had put the Premier League's bottom club ahead 13 minutes into his first appearance, firing home after Adel Taarabt's pin-point pass. But West Ham dominated a breathless second half, levelling through Cole's close-range strike and going close on countless other occasions. QPR held on for a draw but stay bottom. Nevertheless, a point at one his old clubs was another encouraging result for Redknapp's side, who remain unbeaten in 2013. Having kept back-to-back Premier League clean sheets against Chelsea and Tottenham there was more evidence here of a defensive solidity absent in the early months of the season. West Ham went close through Mohamed Diame and Kevin Nolan in the early moments and were denied a penalty by referee Howard Webb when Marouane Chamakh stumbled under the challenge of Clint Hill and went down after a tangle of legs with Shaun Wright-Phillips. But it was clear the arrival of Remy from Marseilles had added to the renewed optimism at QPR. When the Frenchman raced onto Taarabt's beautifully judged through-ball to give the visitors the lead, their burgeoning self-belief was plain to see and Redknapp's side looked an altogether more potent threat as half-time approached. The second half was a very different story, however. West Ham tackled, denied space and dominated territory and their uncomplicated, direct approach forced QPR onto the back foot. Les Ferdinand was among the scorers the last time QPR won at Upton Park in August 1993, the first month of the Premier League season, as the snow began to fall, the hosts battled to preserve their impressive record against Rangers. First, Chamakh's close-range header was turned away by visiting keeper Julio Cesar, and Diame's follow-up shot was blocked by Hill before Kevin Nolan headed narrowly over. Matt Jarvis created another opportunity for Chamakh soon after but the Moroccan's towering header was well saved by Cesar. Hammers substitute Carlton Cole then forced the keeper into another tremendous save, but the Brazilian was unable to hold the striker's header and Joe Cole turned the loose ball into the net from two yards for the first goal of his second spell at West Ham. As West Ham sensed a winner, Winston Reid's fierce goal-bound shot was blocked bravely by Stephane Mbia after a goalmouth scramble, before Joe Cole rounded Cesar only to see his shot turned away by Hill as Rangers held on.  West Ham manager Sam Allardyce: "We couldn't have created more opportunities to score more goals. We're looking very dejected almost like we've lost in the dressing room, because we knew that performance should've got three points. I said to the lads, 'look, carry on like that and you'll win more games than you'll draw'. "At the other end all we've got done by is the sucker punch, which we talked about before the game. It's an encouraging performance to do what we did today, but the frustration and disappointment was it didn't lead to what should've been a comfortable victory."  QPR boss Harry Redknapp: "I couldn't fault the effort but we have to keep the ball and play a bit. If we could have got the ball after scoring I felt the fans would have turned on them. But they were teeing off and dropping balls up to front men. "The players have been excellent we have been on a good little run. We just want to keep that going and keep improving. We are still there [bottom of the table] but we are in much better shape that we were six or seven weeks ago. There will be teams looking over their shoulder."

24.04.2013 23:34:06 Steven Fletcher scored twice as Sunderland came from behind to win a five-goal thriller and send Wigan Athletic into the bottom three. David Vaughan's own goal gave the Latics the lead when he diverted Ronnie Stam's shot into the net. Craig Gardner levelled with a penalty after James McCarthy handled, and Fletcher made it 2-1 from close range. Fletcher found the top corner with an excellent strike, with Angelo Henriquez heading a consolation for Wigan. Eighteen-year-old Henriquez, on loan from Manchester United, set up a grandstand finish at the DW Stadium. But Wigan were once again undone by Fletcher, who has now scored six goals in seven Premier League games against them. While Sunderland's recent problems appear behind them, Roberto Martinez's side are in trouble after another failure in front of their own fans. The Spaniard has seen his side win one of the last 10 Premier League games and their poor home form is a cause of real concern. This was the fifth straight top-flight game they have failed to win at the DW Stadium. In addition, Wigan are the only Premier League club yet to keep a clean sheet at home this season. They have been hurt by injuries to key defenders and the imminent return of Antolin Alcaraz cannot come soon enough. But it may require more than the Paraguay international to fix Wigan's problems. Martinez's men were gifted a fourth-minute lead when Stam's mis-hit shot - following an exquisite pass by Gomez that allowed Jean Beausejour to whip in a low cross - struck Vaughan and flew into the net. But two goals in the space of three minutes turned an entertaining match upside down. The visitors equalised when Gardner sent Ali Al Habsi the wrong way from the spot in the 17th minute - Sunderland's first penalty in 34 matches - after James McCarthy, on his 100th Premier League appearance, handled Sebastian Larsson's free-kick. Backed by 4,800 travelling supporters, the Black Cats were clearly starting to feel at home and they went ahead when Fletcher struck again from close range. Al Habsi kept out the Scot's 20th-minute close-range header from a cross by the lively Alfred N'Diaye - making his first top-flight start - but the striker followed up to score. While Sunderland were commanding and confident, Wigan stuttered. They fell further behind before half-time when Â£12m signing Fletcher found the top corner after collecting a pass from Adam Johnson on the edge of the area. The hosts rallied after the interval, Shaun Maloney twice going close along with Maynor Figueroa. Substitute Henriquez did find the net when the Chilean headed home Maloney's cross but the damage had been done and Sunderland celebrated a fourth win in six league games.  Wigan boss Roberto Martinez on his team's top-flight status: "We never take anything for granted. "If we had done that we would never have had eight seasons at this level. Today we weren't good enough defensively for 30 minutes. We need to rectify that. "Ivan Ramis' injury last week cost us today's points. That is something I need to correct."  Sunderland boss Martin O'Neill: "Fletcher was fantastic. It was not just his goals but also his whole centre forward play. "We took great heart from his performance. We've had to show a lot of fight and determination. "Wigan threw a lot at us but and were never out of it. It was all hands to the pump at the end and I am delighted with the result."

24.04.2013 23:34:06 Chelsea's poor home record under Rafael Benitez continued as Southampton fought back from 2-0 down to snatch a point. Demba Ba leapt to put the Blues ahead with a deflected shot and Eden Hazard added a second before the break, following up when Ramires hit the bar. Saints created little until Rickie Lambert came off the bench to head home Nathaniel Clyne's cross. Jason Puncheon levelled when he smashed home Luke Shaw's cross and Southampton left with an unlikely draw. Chelsea have now won only one out of six domestic games at Stamford Bridge under Benitez and, for the third successive home game, boos rang out at the final whistle. It was easy to understand the home fans' frustrations. This was a game that they seemingly had wrapped up at half-time despite missing several chances but they were rattled by Lambert's introduction and instant impact. Ba could have made sure of the points when he volleyed over in the second half but sloppy defending gave Puncheon room for his explosive finish, which leaves Chelsea 13 points behind leaders Manchester United, with 16 games left. It was only the third time in 90 home matches in the Premier League era that Chelsea had surrendered a 2-0 half-time lead, a slip particularly ill-timed from Benitez's point of view considering the news about Pep Guardiola earlier in the day. The announcement that the long-term Chelsea managerial target is to take charge of Bayern Munich next summer might have been bad news for Blues owner Roman Abramovich, but surely represents a window of opportunity for his interim boss. If Benitez is to stay for longer than the end of this campaign, then results will arguably matter more than the opinion of the fans who have opposed his appointment from the start. At the moment, both are going against him on home turf. Benitez has claimed this is down to the tactics of visiting teams rather than a reaction to the often abusive atmosphere but against Southampton it was poor finishing - and defending - that was to blame. Chelsea were comfortable at the break, taking the lead through Ba's instinctive finish from Cesar Azpilicueta's cross and doubling it when Hazard impressively despatched a bouncing ball from the edge of the area after Ramires had struck the bar. But the home side were given a rude awakening when Saints' top scorer Lambert, left on the bench while his side looked to defend deep and counter-attack before half-time, was summoned for a rescue mission. It took Lambert, the leading English scorer in the top division, precisely two minutes and 47 seconds to announce his arrival in the game, powering home his header for his 10th goal of a productive campaign. Chelsea could still have made the points safe, with Ba missing the target completely after he ran on to Juan Mata's superbly clipped pass, but it was Saints who had the last word as they extended their unbeaten league run to five games. Shaw raided forward down the left flank and his cross was allowed to bounce across the edge of the area, where it was met by Puncheon to take a touch and fire a superb strike past the helpless Cech.  Chelsea interim manager Rafael Benitez: "We should have won. "We didn't take our chances when we had them. We had situations where we could score. We didn't and they broke on a counter-attack. We gave them hope they could score and they did it. "I was talking to the team at half-time, trying to say 'we have to score a third goal'. "I think for us we cannot be happy drawing at home. I am disappointed.  Southampton manager Nigel Adkins: "We came with a game-plan to be compact and frustrate the opposition. "It was a big call to leave Rickie Lambert out but we wanted to make sure we were in the game. "At half-time it was 2-0 and I said, 'stick to the game-plan'. If we had gone and chased it there was every chance we could have ended up with a scoreline like Aston Villa, who conceded eight here. "We stuck at it. Rickie came on and scored the goal and what a fantastic goal it was for the second one.

24.04.2013 23:34:06 Carlos Tevez scored a late winner to maintain Manchester City's slim title hopes with victory over Wigan. City struggled at the Etihad Stadium and were grateful for a fine Joe Hart save from Wigan striker Franco Di Santo in the first half. But Tevez slipped past Paul Scharner and Jordi Gomez before hitting a shot into Joel Robles' top corner. City moved to within 13 points of leaders Manchester United, while Wigan remain three points from safety. Following their impressive form of recent weeks, this was a return to the listlessness that saw City's Premier League title defence fall away in the middle phase of the season. Argentine striker Sergio Aguero was withdrawn at half-time and there had been little spark from Yaya Toure, Samir Nasri or Tevez, with manager Roberto Mancini blaming tiredness after Sunday's 2-1 FA Cup semi-final win over Chelsea for his team's underwhelming display. But Tevez finally struck in the 83rd minute to secure an eighth win in nine league and cup matches. Wigan ultimately came away with nothing, but this was a performance suggesting both that it is folly to write off the Latics' hopes against City in next month's FA Cup final, and that Roberto Martinez's team must have confidence they can once again avoid relegation. They trail Sunderland, Stoke and Aston Villa by three points and still have a game in hand over all three going into their trip to West Ham at the weekend. After a ponderous opening, it took news that West Ham had taken the lead against United to galvanise the crowd but Wigan had the better opportunities in the first half. For the hosts, Aguero skipped infield past Emmerson Boyce and Scharner and bent a shot just beyond the far post. But the visitors passed up two clear chances to take the lead in the space of a minute. A long ball from Di Santo caught out Joleon Lescott, and Arouna Kone failed to control when he would have been clean through on Hart. And after Shaun Maloney flicked a Kone pass into Di Santo's path, the Argentina international drifted past Lescott and Gareth Barry before a low save from Hart denied him. Wigan goalkeeper Robles was worked for the first time when he tipped a mis-hit cross from Aleksandar Kolarov around the post. Mancini brought Edin Dzeko on for Aguero but it was Wigan who continued to carry the greater threat. Maloney eased past Richards and hit a bending shot that beat Hart but was hacked away by Lescott, before Kone also sliced wide after a quick break. An impressive sliding challenge from Vincent Kompany then blocked Kone's close-range effort after passes from Maloney and Di Santo had cut the City defence open. Tevez dragged a shot wide as City's desperation mounted but Hart was worked again when he pushed away a Callum McManaman effort. Home frustration was finally ended when Kolarov picked out Tevez and the Argentine beat two Wigan defenders on the edge of the area before steering a shot into the top corner for his 11th league goal of the season. The goalscorer then missed narrowly with a free kick in added time, but his solitary strike was enough to earn City's seventh straight win over the Latics.

24.04.2013 23:34:06 Manchester City clinched an eventful win at Arsenal to keep up the pressure on leaders Manchester United. The Gunners had Laurent Koscielny sent off after 10 minutes for hauling down Edin Dzeko in the box, but Dzeko saw the resulting penalty saved. City poured forward and James Milner put them ahead with an angled finish. Dzeko made it 2-0 from close range but Arsenal dug in after half-time and Vincent Kompany's late red card meant both sides finished with 10 men. Kompany will feel the decision, for what referee Mike Dean adjudged to be a reckless tackle on Jack Wilshere, was harsh but it gave the Gunners hope in the last 15 minutes. Even then, the home side struggled to create chances, and their first serious shot on target came in the 90th minute when Theo Walcott beat Joe Hart but saw Joleon Lescott clear off the line. City's win did not end up being as resounding as it had threatened to be, but it was still a crucial result in the title race.  Manchester United's victory over Liverpool earlier on Sunday had increased their advantage at the top of the table to 10 points, piling the pressure on City to respond with a positive result. The defending champions' appalling record at Arsenal - they had not beaten the Gunners at the Emirates Stadium or Highbury in the league for more than 37 years - did not offer Roberto Mancini's men much encouragement of managing that before kick-off. But Koscielny's 10th-minute sending off, after he had wrestled Dzeko to the ground inside the area by wrapping two arms around the Bosnian striker to prevent him running on to a Gareth Barry header, handed City the perfect platform to change that awful statistic, and keep their neighbours in sight. Dzeko made a hash of the resulting penalty, firing it straight at Wojciech Szczesny's legs and seeing the Gunners keeper grab the ball after it rolled back towards him along the goalline. It did not take City long to make their extra man count, however. Arsenal switched off at a free-kick, which Barry took quickly, and Carlos Tevez slid Milner clear to beat Szczesny with a powerful angled finish. More chances followed, with Javi Garcia heading the best of them wide. Arsenal could do little but try to halt the relentless pressure, but they conceded a second goal after 32 minutes. Again, more could have been done more to prevent it. Milner fired in a dangerous cross after Pablo Zabaleta got the better of Kieran Gibbs down the right and, although Szczesny kept out Tevez's initial effort, Dzeko was on hand to tap home the rebound. Only a Wilshere header off the line stopped Garcia heading home a third before half-time and, at the interval, City might have been thinking of how they could give their goal-difference a boost. Instead, Arsenal showed commendable spirit to stop the flood of City attacks, even if they rarely threatened at the other end. Szczesny did well to dive at the feet of Tevez when he ran clear but, aside from an Olivier Giroud header that flew over Hart's bar, that was the most meaningful incident of any kind until Kompany saw red. City's captain got the ball when he slid in on Wilshere and protested his innocence to referee Dean, but the official made it clear he felt it was a dangerous challenge. With parity restored in terms of men on the field, the home fans tried to roar their side forward. But the closest Arsenal came to a reply was when substitute Lescott denied Walcott, leaving Arsene Wenger's men six points adrift of a top-four spot, albeit with a game in hand on fourth-placed Tottenham.  Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger: " "It was frustrating [to go down to 10 men] but we got away with it [with the penalty miss]. "We were down to 10 men with 80 minutes to go and knew it would be a difficult game. "We gave away two cheap goals, at 10 men you keep it 0-0 and you never know. "But we were too timid and did not have enough authority on the game. We let them dictate the game to us and when we went 1-0 down it was difficult."  Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini: "If you play with 10 players it is very difficult [like Arsenal had to do for most of the game]. "But, we started with a good attitude and pressed high as we wanted to win the game, it was easier after the sending off. Second half we were too soft and I thought the game could re-open. "It was an important victory. We knew it was difficult to play here [at Emirates Stadium]."

24.04.2013 23:34:06 Manchester United kept a firm grip on the Premier League title race with a deserved victory against Liverpool at Old Trafford. The meeting had been billed as the battle of the strikers between Manchester United's Robin van Persie and Liverpool counterpart Luis Suarez. And it was Van Persie who made the decisive contribution as he put United ahead with a brilliant first-half finish then provided the free-kick for the second after 54 minutes as Patrice Evra's header deflected in off Nemanja Vidic. Liverpool's Â£12m signing from Chelsea Daniel Sturridge scored for the second successive game after coming on as substitute to give Brendan Rodgers's side hope and set up an anxious finish for United. Sturridge missed a glorious chance to give Liverpool a point that their inferiority for the first hour barely deserved, but United closed out the win to go 10 points clear at the top of the table ahead of Manchester City's visit to Arsenal. The scale of Van Persie's influence since his Â£24m summer arrival from Arsenal can be illustrated by the fact that this was his 10th goal in 10 games - and he has scored in nine of them. United were eventually relieved to get the three points after outplaying Liverpool for long periods, only to fail to convert a succession of chances in the opening 45 minutes. One could only imagine manager Sir Alex Ferguson's reaction had they squandered their advantage. Liverpool can take a measure of consolation from a lively closing phase, but the 24-point gap between themselves and the club they regard as fierce rivals makes painful reading. They were too passive and negative until United had a two-goal lead, with Â£15m summer signing Joe Allen looking out of his depth in midfield before he was taken off. Rodgers decided to keep Sturridge on the bench - leaving Suarez with virtually a watching brief in a first half controlled by Manchester United. Netherlands striker Van Persie demonstrated his world class quality to put United ahead after 19 minutes. United opened up Liverpool with controlled possession and Van Persie reacted quicker than Daniel Agger to clip an instant finish past keeper Pepe Reina from Evra's cross. Danny Welbeck was a somewhat surprising selection alongside Van Persie but more than justified his inclusion with an energetic display. He was off target with one effort and then it took a brilliant tackle from Agger to halt the striker after Allen gifted United possession. Allen was fortunate again when his poor defensive header fell to Tom Cleverley, whose crisp volley flew inches wide with Reina beaten. As Liverpool struggled to stay in the game, they had their biggest escape on the stroke of half-time as both Van Persie and Shinji Kagawa failed to turn in Rafael's cross, Reina needing lengthy treatment after being injured in the scramble. Both sides made changes at the interval. Antonio Valencia replaced Ashley Young, who had been injured in a collision with Agger, while Liverpool sent on the more attack-minded Sturridge for Lucas Leiva. It was United who extended their lead nine minutes after the break when poor marking allowed Evra to steal in on Van Persie's free-kick, his header brushing off Vidic to beat Reina. Liverpool, outplayed for so long, needed an instant response and got one as Sturridge was first to react as United keeper David de Gea could only push out Steven Gerrard's shot. At last the battle had been joined, but it still needed Reina to show great athleticism to save from Shinji Kagawa's precise 20-yard effort. Remarkably given their first half domination, United spent the closing minutes hanging on and Sturridge wasted a great chance to give Liverpool an unlikely point after Suarez wriggled his way into the area.

24.04.2013 23:34:06 Aston Villa slipped into the bottom three in controversial circumstances as Jay Rodriguez's blatant first-half dive helped Southampton to a valuable win.  Top scorer Rickie Lambert swept home from the penalty spot after the Â£7m summer signing went down without contact from Enda Stevens in the area. Villa rallied after the break and went closest to an equaliser when Nathan Baker headed onto the crossbar. The result saw the Saints leapfrog Villa and move clear of the drop zone. The winter months have not been kind to Villa's inexperienced side, and the embarrassing midweek League Cup semi-final first-leg defeat to Bradford was their fourth in seven games in all competitions. While Villa's slide down the Premier League table had seen them take only 10 points from their last 11 fixtures, Nigel Adkins's ever-improving Southampton outfit came to Villa Park on the back of only two losses in 10 league games. Despite the disparity in recent form, Villa started the brighter and forced a number of corners as giant centre-forward Christian Benteke repeatedly pressured the slight figure of visiting right-back Nathaniel Clyne. Villa's problems have been exacerbated by a long dry spell in front of goal - they had only scored seven times in their last 10 league matches - and again they were unable to turn momentum into chances. Southampton's superior confidence on the ball then started to show and Rodriguez should have done better after he was smartly played into space on the right wing by Lambert but his control at pace let him down in the area and he could only scuff a weak pass into goalkeeper Brad Guzman's arms. Referee Mark Halsey had earlier angered the Southampton bench by failing to punish a high challenge from Stevens on Gaston Ramirez and a flailing elbow from Benteke on Maya Yoshida, but the game's key officiating decision came in the 33rd minute when he pointed to the spot after Rodriguez tumbled in the area. While the furious Villa players raced to question Halsey's call, Rodriguez attempted to plead his innocence by mouthing: "I did not dive." Lambert, who joined joined Southampton for Â£1m in 2009, then stepped up to send Guzan the wrong way and retain his perfect penalty record for the club. Villa manager Paul Lambert took off the ineffectual Brett Holman at half-time and switched to a 4-4-2 formation, and his decision led to a much improved performance. Benteke should have scored his 10th goal of the season after he picked up on goalkeeper Artur Boruc's dangerous parry from Stevens' 25-yard effort but the Belgium international could only side-foot his effort over the crossbar. The previously invisible Charles N'Zogbia then struck a firm low drive into the Pole's arms, though Southampton's dangerous attacking options came to the fore once again as the exciting Jason Puncheon struck the base of the post after cutting inside from the right. Villa continued to push for a vital leveller and again Benteke was the man at the centre of things. First, he smartly twisted into space on the edge of the area before firing a wild effort wide with his left foot , then a more measured curling effort with his favoured right went inches beyond the post. A desperate late rally went to no avail as Baker hit the woodwork for Villa before Benteke and substitute Jordan Bowery failed to find the target with close-range efforts. While Wigan's draw at Fulham pushed Villa into the bottom-three, Southampton's resilience was rewarded with a fifth win in six games against their fellow strugglers.

24.04.2013 23:34:06 Everton's hopes of qualifying for the Champions League suffered a setback as they were held to a goalless draw by Swansea City at Goodison Park. The Toffees carved out a string of chances against the Capital One Cup semi-finalists but failed to score for the first time in 19 league games. Michel Vorm denied Victor Anichebe, while the Swans keeper also frustrated Nikica Jelavic and Phil Neville. Swansea's best chance saw Tim Howard tip Michu's effort onto the bar. Spain's coach Vicente del Bosque was present to witness Michu go close to his 14th Premier League goal in his 21st appearance. But while the Â£2m signing from Rayo Vallecano looks set to break into his national side next month, Everton have their work cut out if they are are secure a top-four finish. Despite keeping a first clean sheet in the league for four months, David Moyes' side paid the price for failing to take their chances on a frustrating afternoon for the hosts. Everton dominated Swansea in the last meeting between the teams in September and the Merseyside club once again bossed the opening exchanges with Jelavic having three chances in the opening 15 minutes alone. The Croatian international was denied by Vorm as early as the third minute, the Swansea keeper reacting well after his side had carelessly gifted possession just outside his penalty box. Vorm then raced outside his area to block a follow-up by Anichebe, before a mis-kick by Jelavic bounced narrowly wide after the former Rangers striker had connected with Pienaar's teasing delivery in the ninth minute. After Jelavic went close with a glancing header, Vorm again came to Swansea's rescue when the Dutch keeper took the sting out of Anichebe's goal-bound header which allowed Ashley Williams to clear off the line. It was all Everton but Michu delivered a sharp reminder that Swansea, fresh from their Capital One Cup heroics at Chelsea, were still very much in the game. In front of his national manager, the 26-year-old let fly from an acute angle, following a delightful ball from Nathan Dyer, which Tim Howard flicked onto his bar for what was the Everton keeper's only serious save of the first half. Everton had scored in the last 18 Premier League games yet they continued to squander chances after the interval. Phil Neville and Sylvain Distin both went close before Pablo Hernandez stung Howard's fingers in the closing stages. Swansea dug deep to stretch their unbeaten league run to five matches and will head for Wednesday's FA Cup third-round replay at Arsenal  in high spirits.  Everton manager David Moyes:  "We're a bit frustrated but Swansea did a really good job in midweek on Chelsea, not dissimilar (to this). "We needed to play a bit better, pass it a bit quicker and be a little bit cleverer in the final third. "We had three or four good opportunities, but just not perfect (ones). "Swansea have had a busy week, a hard week, and it is a great point for them. We're just disappointed we couldn't turn our opportunities into goals."  Swansea manager Michael Laudrup:  "It has been a little bit more than a good week - it has been a great week. "Three very difficult games, different games, and I think three great performances. "To come here and play Everton in such a difficult away game, after playing in midweek against Chelsea, and to get a point is a great result. "Once more, it was a great performance, although maybe getting the points in a different way that we are used to."

24.04.2013 23:34:06 Franco Di Santo's first Premier League goal in three months earned Wigan Athletic a deserved point at Fulham. The hosts had gone ahead through Giorgos Karagounis's 25-yard strike. Di Santo missed from close range after Emmerson Boyce's cross, before Shaun Maloney's deflected 25-yard effort was spectacularly tipped onto the bar. But Wigan equalised when Di Santo cut in from the left wing, ran unchallenged and fired past Mark Schwarzer to lift his side out of the bottom three. However, there was nearly late drama at Craven Cottage as Bryan Ruiz's shot was headed off the line by Maynor Figueroa to deny Fulham victory. Fulham have still only won four home league games this season but made a bright start as Mladen Petric wasted a free-kick from just outside the penalty area and then shot over with a wild effort from a similar distance. The game's first bit of class came from Ruiz, who delightfully chipped a pass over the Wigan defence, but Dimitar Berbatov could not collect the ball as Latics goalkeeper Ali Al Habsi gathered. Fulham went ahead in the 22nd minute when Karagounis, who also scored from long range against Blackpool in the FA Cup last week, grabbed another as his 25-yard strike went in off the post. The Greek midfielder's first Premier League goal meant Wigan have now gone behind in 15 of their 22 league matches this season. Of the previous 14 games in which they have conceded first, they had gone on to lose all but one of them. But at Craven Cottage they showed their resilience as they were the better side for the rest of the match. James McArthur's weak shot from 18 yards was straight at Schwarzer before Di Santo should have scored but wasted a chance from five yards. In the second half, Maloney's deflected 25-yard effort was tipped onto the bar by Schwarzer, who produced a stunning fingertip save to keep his side ahead as the Cottagers clung on. Kieran Richardson produced an excellent piece of defending when he slid in to deny Di Santo in the penalty area after a storming run forward from James McCarthy, before Maloney shot at the Fulham goalkeeper. Di Santo, with an exquisite piece of skill, then flicked the ball up and volleyed on the turn but his shot went narrowly wide. However, Wigan grabbed the goal their play deserved when a quickly taken free-kick allowed Di Santo to cut in from the left-wing, run unchallenged to the edge of the penalty area and blast the ball past Schwarzer for his first Premier League goal since 6 October. Di Santo had a chance to claim all three points when he again ran at the Fulham defence, created some space and fired a low shot from 12 yards which Schwarzer did well to push wide. Then, down at the other end, Ruiz's shot was headed off the line by Figueroa. The point gained takes Wigan out of the bottom three and above Aston Villa into 17th, while Fulham remain 13th, six points above the relegation zone.  Fulham boss Martin Jol said: "If you are 1-0 up you have to score a second goal and we were very sloppy. We lost the ball and kept them in the game. We've had two disappointing results but we have to take it. "I wouldn't say we're in a relegation battle but we need the points. "We don't have all of the millions to spend but you have to be creative. Sometimes you could do with one of two quality players and hopefully we will do something."  Wigan manager Roberto Martinez said: "It's a decent point overall but I'm sure we had most of the threat and, with the amount of opportunities we had, I'm disappointed we could only get one goal. "It's a tough place to come once you give them a goal lead. Every time we went forward we carried a real goal threat and Mark Schwarzer's save from Shaun Maloney is the save of the weekend and probably the save of the season."  On Ivan Ramis's injury [the defender was carried off on a stretcher late on], Martinez added: "I thought he was outstanding from the first minute until he had to come off. "We fear he has damaged his ligaments in his right knee. We will have to see the scan but I fear the worst."

24.04.2013 23:34:06 An uninspiring affair at Carrow Road ended in a goalless draw between Norwich and Newcastle. Gabriel Obertan had a well-struck shot smartly saved by Canaries' keeper Mark Bunn but chances were in short supply. Norwich defender Russell Martin went close in the second half, only to see his long-range shot hit the post. Anthony Pilkington had a late chance for the home side but, after cutting inside, his 15-yard shot was saved by keeper Tim Krul. While those at Carrow Road may not have found much solace from the match, the draw checked a run of defeats suffered by both camps. Norwich had lost their last four league games and Newcastle, who are only two points above the relegation zone, earned their first point in four games. The Magpies, however, remain without an away win this season and never looked like changing that statistic against former manager Chris Hughton's Norwich side. Newcastle centre-back Fabricio Coloccini, who has asked to leave the club to return to his native Argentina, did start for Alan Pardew's side, along with the club's new signing, right-back Mathieu Debuchy, and the visitors almost caught their hosts cold from the kick-off. Canaries' centre-back Sebastien Bassong let a long ball go, only for Obertan to steal in behind him and deliver a low cross for striker Papiss Cisse which was intercepted by keeper Mark Bunn. Obertan also had a 25-yard effort saved by Bunn but that was a rare moment of excitement in a disappointing match. Both sides lacked any bite to their attack, with Cisse struggling to fill the void left by Demba Ba, who has joined Chelsea.  The home side's struggles were epitomised when they failed to make the most of a counter-attack which pitted three of their players against two back-tracking Newcastle defenders. The move ended with Simeon Jackson pulling the ball back for Wes Hoolahan, who took a touch instead of shooting first time and let Magpies midfielder James Perch run back to get in a vital tackle. Norwich hinted there might be an improvement immediately after the break when a lovely move ended with Hoolahan's cross for the in-rushing Bradley Johnson being cleared by Obertan. There was more urgency from the home side in the second half, although Newcastle's dogged defending restricted any clear-cut chances. The Magpies brought on key midfielder Yohan Cabaye for his first appearance for them since 11 November, while Norwich striker Grant Holt's 67th-minute introduction signalled his return from a hamstring problem.  Neither could help break the deadlock, although Pilkington did threaten a goal when he cut inside before having his shot saved by Krul. Pilkington also went close in the final moments of the match but could not divert Holt's header across goal into the net.  Norwich manager Chris Hughton:  "Our final ball and our delivery from set plays let us down. "On the balance of play we were the better team but you have to score goals and we weren't able to do that. "Certainly, in the end it was not a bad point."  Newcastle boss Alan Pardew:  "I don't want to comment too much [about Coloccini]. It's club business and we will talk to him this week."  On the match:  "It was a more favourable result for us than for Norwich as they were the home side. It was two teams that worked hard and restricted the opposition. "For us it was important to get a clean sheet. We worked hard in the week and it showed. "I had the luxury of putting some senior players on the pitch and the result showed that. That was a key game. We have Reading at home and Aston Villa away coming up so it is an important time for us. "Hopefully, we will bring in a couple [of new signings] because we need to be a lot stronger."

24.04.2013 23:34:06 Three goals in the final eight minutes gave Reading an unlikely win over West Brom at the Madejski Stadium. Romelu Lukaku had scored either side of half-time to give the dominant Baggies a deserved lead. But Jimmy Kebe pulled one back before Adam Le Fondre's penalty drew the home side level with two minutes to go. Pavel Pogrebnyak dived in from close range to put Reading ahead on 90 minutes and they hung on for only their third win of the season. The dramatic finale keeps Reading in 19th position, two points clear of QPR at the foot of the Premier League table, while West Brom will wonder how they failed to earn anything from a game they controlled until the final stages. Royals manager Brian McDermott handed a debut to Portuguese midfielder Daniel Carrico, who signed from Sporting Lisbon at the start of January. A run of two wins in the last eight games had seen West Brom slip back from a high point of third in the table, but despite the recent wobble in form, the Baggies were already 11 points better off than at the same stage last season. The home side started brightly and ensured much of the opening phase was played in West Brom's half, but despite a series of corners West Brom's defence prevented goalkeeper Ben Foster from seeing much of the ball. But it was Foster's opposite number, Adam Federici, who made the game's first save of note after a quarter of an hour, palming away a shot that James Morrison had hit on the half-volley from the edge of the box. The chance was a warning note from the visitors, who took the lead a minute later when Morrison turned provider. The Scot combined with Lukaku to peel away to the left before placing a low cross that the on-loan Chelsea striker converted from inside the six-yard box for his eighth goal of the season. Reading responded with urgency, but without enough guile or craft to threaten Foster. Jimmy Kebe's poor first touch to a long clearance allowed the West Brom defence to recover. Carrico's debut came to abrupt end at half-time when McDermott replaced him with Garath McCleary, but the change made little difference to the confident visitors, and especially Lukaku. The Belgian striker saw a last-ditch block from Adrian Mariappa stop him from hitting the target, and he had the ball in the net a minute later when he stretched to poke the ball home, only to be flagged for offside. Lukaku hit the post and the bar before finally getting his second, racing on to a clearance from defence to shoot low past Federici's left hand to put West Brom within reach of all three points. But Reading transformed in the latter stages to grab a much-needed win. Kebe stooped low to head home McCleary's cross, and it was Kebe who was clumsily fouled by Jonas Olsson to give substitute Le Fondre the chance to equalise from 12 yards. Spurred on by a raucous home crowd, Reading sealed their comeback in the final minute of normal time when Pogrebnyak bundled in a knock-down from Alex Pearce past Foster. Just a few minutes earlier Reading had been set to slip to the foot of the table, but the turnaround now puts them three points short of Aston Villa in the relegation zone.  Reading manager Brian McDermott said: "I'm looking forward to watching the last eight minutes of that game! It just sums up the atmosphere around the Madejski Stadium, the crowd really got us back into the game. Once Jimmy scored, they were fantastic. "That was a big three points today, I thought the character and resilience of our players was excellent. "We were a little bit flat in the first half, they hit the bar and the post, but we stayed in the game and showed quality when we needed to."  West Brom manager Steve Clarke said: "We went from complete control of the game to somehow losing a game we should have won comfortably. "I'm a little bit shell-shocked. For 81 minutes we had so much control of the game, we created chances, hit the crossbar and post, and scored two good goals. "We were so far in front you could not see the end to the game coming. But football can sometimes be a strange game."

24.04.2013 23:34:06 Jon Walters scored two own goals and missed a penalty as Chelsea thumped Stoke to end the Potters' 17-game home unbeaten run in the Premier League. Walters headed a Cesar Azpilicueta cross into his own net just before half-time and repeated his unwanted trick from a Juan Mata corner. Frank Lampard made it 3-0 from the spot after Mata was fouled and Eden Hazard smashed in a fourth from 30 yards out. Walters' misery was completed when he blasted a late penalty against the bar. The 29-year-old Republic of Ireland international has won plenty of plaudits for his play for the Potters this season but his 100th Premier League appearance turned into a memorable day for all the wrong reasons. Chelsea move third in the table with what became a runaway victory but they were under the cosh for long spells early on and were grateful to assistant referee Sian Massey for correctly reversing a decision to award Stoke a penalty with the score at 1-0. Referee Andre Marriner pointed to the spot when Azpilicueta slid in to bring down Matthew Etherington inside the area, but Massey had already flagged Etherington offside. Stoke, who have never beaten Chelsea at the Britannia Stadium, had begun the game brightly, bombarding the visitors with balls into the box and seeing Kenwyne Jones fire narrowly wide. Demba Ba was making his Premier League debut for Chelsea but, in the early stages, he was busier in his own area and twice had to hack clear. Ba, preferred to Fernando Torres up front, got more involved at the other end of the pitch as the half progressed. He provided the flick for Lampard to burst into the area and bring a reflex save from Asmir Begovic, then ran clear himself to force another fine stop. Then came Walters first faux pas, which saw him send a bullet header past Begovic as he tried to beat Mata to a cross. His second own goal came moments after Massey had denied Stoke a penalty. This time Walters beat Lampard to Mata's delivery and saw the ball bounce in. Lampard's powerful spot-kick, from a penalty awarded when Robert Huth pushed Mata, left the home side with no way back. Stoke's first home defeat in the league since February last year, and their heaviest at the Britannia Stadium since they returned to the top flight in 2008, was confirmed when Hazard span into space 30 yards from goal and unleashed an unstoppable shot into the top corner. There was more good news for Chelsea when John Terry came off the bench with 10 minutes left for his first appearance in two months, but there was to be no happy ending for Walters. He was fouled by Terry inside the area with only seconds to go and stepped up to take the spot-kick himself, only to slam it against the bar.

24.04.2013 23:34:06 Impressive Sunderland brushed aside woeful West Ham with an emphatic win to ease relegation fears on Wearside. Sebastian Larsson's 25-yard thunderbolt lit up a dour first half, before Adam Johnson pounced after a Dan Potts error to double the lead from close range. Jack Colback hit the woodwork as West Ham began to crumble, before James McClean finished from a tight angle. The visitors failed to threaten until the end, when Ricardo Vaz Te and James Tomkins were denied by Simon Mignolet. The 3-0 scoreline was no less than Sunderland deserved for taking full advantage of an abject display by the visitors. Larsson's sublime opener was the only real moment of quality in the first half, but after the break the Black Cats tormented their opponents with some slick counter-attacking football. Sunderland now sit one point behind the Hammers as both sides' seasons take on a distinctly mid-table feel. On this evidence, Sam Allardyce's side should be the more concerned about the possibility of being dragged into a relegation battle, but they could do nothing about Larsson's spectacular 12th-minute strike. When Alou Diarra's headed clearance fell to the Swede, he took two touches before slamming a swerving left-footed drive past the helpless Jussi Jaaskelainen for his first goal of the season. Sunderland were content to keep 10 men behind the ball after taking the lead, and West Ham lacked the guile to break them down, with the absence of injured midfielder Mark Noble keenly felt. West Ham then contributed to their own downfall for the crucial second goal: a Premier League debut moment to forget for their 18-year-old defender Dan Potts. After Jaaskelainen did superbly to save McClean's strike, Potts dallied on the rebound and the ball fell for Johnson to finish clinically from five yards. The visitors were then lucky to not concede again when Colback smashed an effort against the woodwork following some sloppy defending. Allardyce's side failed to muster even a corner until the 62nd minute, and they fell further behind to a strike with a touch of comedy about it. The impressive Stephane Sessegnon raced into the box but completely miscued his shot, which fell fortuitously into the path of McClean to tuck away from an acute angle. West Ham introduced loan signing Marouane Chamakh and finally began to create chances in the closing stages. Vaz Te and Tomkins forced fine stops from Mignolet, but the Hammers could not add to their paltry tally of five away goals for the season - the lowest in the Premier League.  Sunderland manager Martin O'Neill : "The win was important for us. I think anybody in the bottom half of the table still has to be looking anxiously over their shoulder. "We were brilliant from start to finish. We were energised after having a couple days off after the Bolton game. "We put West Ham on the back foot from the beginning, and a great goal from Seb (Larsson) settled us down." "I think it's our fourth win in seven games in the Premier League and in the context of things, it was good to win."  West Ham manager Sam Allardyce: "We didn't have the appetite for defending correctly and we never passed the ball as well as we know we can. "(The second goal) was pathetic, wasn't it? We have a free-kick and we let the opposition score. "The level of difference in performance between this game and last week against Manchester United is just staggering. "There are too many of my defenders injured; George McCartney, Joey O'Brien and today James Collins. I am really going to have to go and try to strengthen that area in the next few days."

24.04.2013 23:34:06 QPR put in a tenacious display as they earned manager Harry Redknapp a draw against his former club, Tottenham. R's keeper Julio Cesar tipped a Jermain Defoe shot onto the post and saved Emmanuel Adebayor's follow-up early on. But that was a rare scare for a resolute home side, who went close when Shaun Wright-Phillips had a shot deflected wide by Michael Dawson. Defoe also had a second-half shot saved by the leg of Cesar but the visitors could not break down their rivals. The match was Redknapp's first against Spurs since he was sacked by the White Hart Lane outfit last summer.  Having insisted that he bore no animosity either to his former employers or to his successor Andre Villas-Boas, Redknapp might have a slight smile of satisfaction as his relegation-battling side ended Tottenham's run of four successive wins. The visitors' record of having scored in every away game in the top flight so far this season was also ended as they failed to show the guile and creativity to break down the Hoops, who again showed signs of improvement to suggest they can avoid the drop. QPR had registered a shock win over Chelsea in their last league outing and the Loftus Road side continued to show the hard-working attitude and resilience that victory was built on to frustrate Spurs. Employing a 4-5-1 formation with playmaker Adel Taarabt playing as a striker, the home side shut down the time and space the visitors had on the ball with admirable determination and discipline. When QPR were almost breached, keeper Cesar came to their rescue with a top-class double save. The Brazilian tipped a 22-yard Defoe shot against the post and, after Adebayor latched on to the rebound, sidestepped defender Clint Hill and got in a low shot from 12 yards, Cesar got a hand to the strike to send it over. That was as close as Tottenham got to a goal as they struggled to make their superior quality count against the home side's work-rate. QPR's defensive solidity came at the cost of tempering them offensively, although a rare foray forward from them did almost stun Spurs. Taarabt stabbed a piercing pass through the Spurs defence into the run of Wright-Phillips, who cut inside before his effort was deflected wide by lunging centre-back Michael Dawson. The home side were impressively nullifying the threat of Spurs wingers Gareth Bale and Aaron Lennon and, while the entire QPR side were playing their part, Stephane Mbia and Jamie Mackie deserve honorary mentions. Midfielder Mbia's strong presence and Mackie's tigerish play set the tone for their side. Still Tottenham dominated possession but could not capitalise, with fleeting chances seeing Kyle Walker send a free-kick just high and Cesar again rescuing his side when he saved a Defoe shot with his leg. QPR's best hope of a goal was to catch Tottenham off-guard and they almost did so when Taarabt played a pass through to Wright-Phillips, who was thwarted by Spurs keeper Hugo Lloris rushing out of his goal to clear. Wright-Phillips nearly created a late chance for himself when he surged at the Spurs defence only to stumble as the match ended in stalemate.  QPR manager Harry Redknapp:  "That was very bit as good as the performance against Chelsea (a 1-0 win) - we worked our socks off against a real top team today. I can't ask for more than that. "We restricted to them very few opportunities. Nedum Onouha and Fabio nullified two fantastic wingers That was the quietest I've seen Gareth Bale for many a year."  With regard to the transfer window, Redknapp added:  "You hope you can get a couple of players in but if you don't we keep going with what we have. "If we can get the right players I'll bring them in, I won't bring them in for the sake of it."  Spurs manager Andre Villas-Boas:  "They defended very well; we wanted to play with a higher tempo, but they frustrate you. "Julio Cesar had a great game. We had some big chances; in a game like this it's important to score first. "It was a difficult game for us, but we got an away point so we are satisfied."  When asked about Redknapp Villas-Boas said:  "I have tried to be respectful and I think Harry is the same. He's been a great example to follow so there are no hard feelings."

24.04.2013 23:34:06 Manchester United inched closer to regaining the Premier League title despite being held to a draw by West Ham United at Upton Park. Robin van Persie's controversial equaliser 20 minutes from time rescued a point for United as they struggled for long spells to discover the form that has led them to the brink of a 20th top-flight crown. Ricardo Vaz Te gave West Ham - still looking to make survival mathematically certain - an early lead but Shinji Kagawa's superb run produced a leveller for Antonio Valencia before half-time. Mohamed Diame's stunning strike then restored West Ham's lead before Van Persie turned in United's second in the 77th minute after Kagawa's deflected shot rebounded off both posts - although replays showed the Dutchman was in an offside position. United's lead now stands at 13 points after second-placed Manchester City beat relegation-threatened Wigan but this was a performance that smacked more of a stroll towards the finishing line than a triumphant dash. The fact that the title is now a formality has perhaps taken some of the edge off Sir Alex Ferguson's side but it is only matter of time before they will be champions again. The extent of United's struggles, at least until a trademark period of late pressure, was summed up by Wayne Rooney, who was desperately poor and could have no complaints when he was substituted with 20 minutes left. Andy Carroll's failure to establish himself at Liverpool and subsequent injury problems at West Ham have curtailed his England career - but his lively display will have impressed watching England manager Roy Hodgson. He played a crucial role as West Ham took the lead after 16 minutes. Matt Jarvis escaped from Rio Ferdinand far too easily to find Carroll at the far post and he nodded back for Vaz Te to throw himself forward and score with a diving header from six yards. United's response was subdued but they drew level with the smoothest of equalisers 14 minutes before half-time. Kagawa demonstrated perfect balance and footwork to skip through the Hammers defence and set up a simple sidefoot finish for Valencia. Carroll had been West Ham's main threat but he infuriated Ferguson moments before the interval when he recklessly launched himself at a corner, taking out Patrice Evra and United keeper David de Gea in the process. Nothing had been seen of Rooney but he finally made a contribution of some significance right after the restart when his perfect cross found Van Persie, whose header was just behind Phil Jones, however, meaning the defender was unable to make a proper connection. Having escaped punishment for the earlier incident, Carroll was then booked by referee Lee Probert for a harmless looking tangle with De Gea after the keeper collected a cross. Carroll then gave De Gea another anxious moment, this time with a long-range dipping effort that went into the side netting. West Ham were playing with far more purpose at this stage and were rewarded in spectacular style with a second goal after 55 minutes. Diame, a real talent, eluded Rooney with embarrassing ease before firing a low, angled drive beyond De Gea from 20 yards. Rooney almost snatched another equaliser when Jussi Jaaskelainen fumbled his half-hit shot from a corner but Gary O'Neil was on the line to rescue West Ham's veteran keeper. The Finn was in more accomplished action to turn Van Persie's header over the top before Ferguson made his first change with 20 minutes remaining. Despite the fact that United were trailing, it was little surprise that Rooney was the man replaced by Ryan Giggs after a performance lacking in intensity and quality. As ever with United, even when below their best they possess a threat and so it proved again as they restored parity once more with 13 minutes left. Kawaga's shot from the edge of the area deflected off James Collins and hit both posts before Van Persie turned in from a very tight angle.

24.04.2013 23:34:06 Substitute Victor Anichebe scored within 90 seconds of coming on to give Everton victory at Newcastle. The hosts took the lead in the second minute of the game when Papiss Cisse capitalised on a Toffees defensive error to head home. James Perch hit a post for the home side but Leighton Baines levelled with a stunning free-kick. Anichebe, introduced just before the hour, converted Nikica Jelavic's cross from close range shortly afterwards. Transfer target Demba Ba was withdrawn from the Newcastle squad earlier in the day when Chelsea triggered a release clause in the striker's contract, but barely one minute was showing on the clock when the hosts took the lead. Goalkeeper Tim Krul's free-kick floated towards the Everton defence and when Sylvain Distin and Johnny Heitinga collided, Cisse took the chance to nod the ball past Tim Howard. Krul denied Baines with two good saves within seconds of each other, firstly to touch away a long-range free-kick and then bravely at the left-back's feet as he tried to scramble the ball in ahead of Jelavic. Marouane Fellaini looked refreshed in his first match since completing a three-match suspension, and the Belgian saw a half-chance blocked by a well-timed tackle from Davide Santon but Newcastle went closer to scoring when James Perch headed against the post. But Everton equalised in spectacular fashion two minutes before half-time, Baines driving in a free kick from 30 yards that swerved past Krul's right hand after flying wide of the Newcastle wall. Shola Ameobi, included after Ba was withdrawn from the squad, was inches away from retaking the lead for Newcastle five minutes into the second half, the striker doing well to bring down a chip from Vurnon Anita before seeing his shot roll just wide of Howard's left-hand post. Manager David Moyes replaced Steven Naismith with Anichebe, and his decision quickly paid off in style as a move involving Steven Pienaar, Fellaini and Jelavic down Everton's left flank was smartly finished off by Anichebe from close range when he poked the ball home between Krul's legs. Cisse was then thwarted twice in quick succession, Heitinga blocking a header before the Senegal international flicked the rebound at Howard while falling to the ground. But Everton hung on for a win that lifts them to fifth place in the Premier League table, while Newcastle are two points above the relegation zone following their ninth defeat in 11 games.  Newcastle manager Alan Pardew: "We had a great start, I thought it was pretty even for long periods. They have a lot more experience and quality on the pitch than perhaps we did tonight. "We had big players missing, but our effort was outstanding and I can't fault them for that, they gave everything. "If we can get a bit more quality back in the team and maybe one or two in, which is probably important now, we'll be OK."  Everton manager David Moyes: "The first goal was a brilliantly struck free-kick, the second was a brilliantly worked move with good passing and good interchange of play. "I thought we played well, especially in the first half, I thought the second half got a bit harder but I was really pleased with the goals "I'm pleased that we have finished this Christmas-New Year period with a decent amount of points."

24.04.2013 23:34:06 QPR snatched a stunning win over Chelsea at Stamford Bridge through a late Shaun Wright-Phillips strike. The Premier League's bottom side shocked their in-form hosts when Wright-Phillips smashed home from the edge of the area after a corner. Chelsea, chasing a fifth straight win, dominated throughout but could not break down QPR's packed defence. Frank Lampard had a goal ruled out for offside and the Blues' best effort saw Julio Cesar deny Fernando Torres. This was a far from vintage attacking display from Rafael Benitez's side, who put eight past Aston Villa in their last game on home turf. But what was looking like being a frustrating evening for the Blues turned into a disastrous one at the hands of one of their former players when Wright-Phillips delivered his sucker-punch, 12 minutes from time. The former England winger did not sparkle on too many occasions in four years at Chelsea from 2005 to 2008, following his Â£21m move from Manchester City, and he has struggled to make too much of an impression with Rangers either. Wright-Phillips' popularity around Loftus Road will soar after this goal, however. It came after he had been brought off the bench early on to replace the injured Junior Hoilett, and could prove invaluable to Harry Redknapp's side and their bid to stay up. Things never looked straightforward for Chelsea, who may rue their decision to begin with Juan Mata and Eden Hazard on the bench after a defeat that deals a severe blow to their title hopes. The Blues were lucky to keep 11 men on the pitch when Marko Marin marked his first league start by clattering into QPR midfielder Stephane Mbia with a wild lunge after just four minutes. Fortunately for Marin, and for Chelsea, referee Lee Mason elected only to book the German international. But things did not improve much for the home side, who rarely looked like breaking down a determined QPR backline in the first half. Torres, who might soon face competition from Newcastle striker Demba Ba for his starting place, was starved of service as the visitors defended deep and in numbers. Instead it was left to his team-mates to shoot from distance, and nothing summed up Chelsea's lethargic opening better than two horribly wayward efforts from defender Branislav Ivanovic. QPR did not offer much at the other end but, with Adel Taarabt operating as their furthest man forward in a 4-5-1 formation, that was never their intention. Instead they looked to soak up the home side's pressure, a tactic that worked so well that Cesar's first save came just before the break, when he stopped Oscar's deflected shot with an outstretched leg before Victor Moses fired over from the rebound. Rangers had kept only one clean sheet in their last 26 top flight away games - and surrendered meekly against Liverpool three days ago - but they continued to keep Chelsea at bay in the second half. Moses should have done better from a low Marin cross and Ivanovic headed over before Cesar kept out a Torres snap-shot after David Luiz's shot had been blocked. Lampard thought he had drawn level with Kerry Dixon as Chelsea's second highest scorer when he did find the net from a corner, but his celebrations of what would have been his 193rd goal for the club were cut short by the linesman's flag. By now, QPR had created a few half-chances too, but Wright-Phillips' goal still provided a twist in the tale that few had seen coming. Taarabt teed him up on the edge of the area and he drilled a low strike past Ross Turnbull and into the bottom corner of the net. QPR stay bottom, five points adrift of safety, but after three straight defeats, this win will give them renewed hope that survival is not beyond them.  Chelsea interim manager Rafael Benitez on his side's defeat, and his decision to rest several players:  "We were tired and weren't precise. We made a mistake and gave them their chance. "I don't regret the changes because we can't carry on with the same players in every game. "If you're playing a team at the bottom of the table at home, you have to trust your players and I trust them."  QPR boss Harry Redknapp on his players' performance:  "They worked their socks off and they got their rewards, we deserved it and it was a fantastic performance. "They have set the standard tonight and to get out of this mess they have to do it every week."

24.04.2013 23:34:07 Luis Suarez took his Premier League tally to 15 goals for the season by scoring twice to help Liverpool ease to victory against Sunderland. Watched by new Anfield signing Daniel Sturridge, Raheem Sterling's lobbed goal gave the Reds an early lead. Suarez doubled Liverpool's advantage soon after, racing into the area before stabbing the ball home. The Uruguayan then made it 3-0 early in the second half with a close-range strike from Steven Gerrard's pass. The win means Liverpool have recorded back-to-back league victories for the second time this season and moves them up to eighth in the table. For Sunderland it was their second successive defeat following the 2-1 loss to Tottenham at the weekend and they remain 14th. Liverpool's attacking display would have impressed Sturridge, who completed the formalities of his move from Chelsea in the hours before kick-off. Despite a confident start by Sunderland, it was the home side who were the first to threaten in the 11th minute when Suarez was fouled just outside the area and Stewart Downing curled the resulting free-kick towards the near post, but keeper Simon Mignolet did well to push the ball behind for a corner. Liverpool's opening goal came eight minutes later. Suarez brought a Gerrard pass under control before expertly lofting the ball over the defence to release Sterling and the young England winger showed great composure to draw out Mignolet before lobbing the ball into the net. The Sunderland defence were struggling to deal with Liverpool's pacey attacks and the hosts took full advantage by adding a second in the 26th minute. Gerrard knocked the ball forward for Suarez to chase down the right and, though the Uruguayan was fouled by Carlos Cuellar, he stayed on his feet to charge towards goal and power a neat finish beyond Mignolet. Despite the two-goal deficit, Sunderland still carried a threat when they got forward and they had a great chance to pull a goal back when Adam Johnson's deep cross found Matthew Kilgallon inside the area, but the defender's half volley was superbly denied by Pepe Reina. Sterling and Suarez continued to combine well and cause Sunderland problems after the break, and a fine move involving the pair should have brought a third goal five minutes into the second half. Suarez smartly clipped a Gerrard pass forward to send Sterling clear again, but this time the 18-year-old could not match the composure he showed for his goal as he fizzed a shot well wide. Liverpool did add a third two minutes later when Gerrard delivered a pass from 60 yards for Suarez to collect and shoot beyond Mignolet from close range. From then on, Liverpool were firmly in control and had plenty of chances to add to their advantage. A Gerrard shot deflected off Glen Johnson towards goal but Mignolet did well to push the ball over the bar, before the Sunderland keeper raced out to deny Suarez his hat-trick. Both Johnson and substitute Joe Allen had efforts ruled out for offside, but with the damage already done, Liverpool comfortably saw out the remainder of the game to ensure 2013 got off to the ideal start.  Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers said: "The star was our team. Luis Suarez got two goals and Raheem Sterling got one but that is their job and the team was brilliant. "It was the fourth game in a short period of time and their work rate and intensity was incredible. I am very, very happy, it is another win for us and we can look forward to the next game. "Luis has been absolutely fantastic. He moves well, he is a real threat and he is a real pleasure to work with. He is that Lionel Messi type of player in that he gets kicked all over the place but he gets up and he produces."  Sunderland manager Martin O'Neill said: "At half time in the game we felt as if we could have got a goal and we perhaps created the better chances, but we were unable to take them. "They got the third goal and that was important. If we scored before then it would have got us back into the game but at 3-0, Liverpool are very strong. "With the Christmas period we have had, if you had said we would get six points from four games against the teams we have played, I probably would have accepted that. It is up to us now, we have some points on board but it is still a tough old time."

24.04.2013 23:34:07 Southampton climbed out of the Premier League relegation zone after securing a draw with Arsenal but were unfortunate not to pick up all three points. The Saints went ahead when Gaston Ramirez seized on a loose ball and drilled past Wojciech Szczesny. But Arsenal hit back before the break when Guly do Prado diverted Theo Walcott's free-kick into his own net. Ramirez thought he had given the hosts the lead but his sharp strike was ruled out for a foul on Laurent Koscielny. A winning goal would have been just reward for a performance in which Southampton largely outplayed their illustrious opponents. After losing their first four league games, the Saints have only suffered two defeats in their last 10 and have now leapfrogged Wigan to exit the relegation zone on goal difference. In attack, Ramirez and Rickie Lambert were a constant menace to the Gunners defence, whilst at the other end Theo Walcott was starved of service after being given another chance to press his claims for a regular starting berth up front. Walcott cut a forlorn figure in an Arsenal side that was a pale imitation of the team that scored 15 goals in winning their previous four games. Manager Arsene Wenger fielded the same eleven that had beaten Newcastle 7-3 three days earlier but saw his team fade badly after a bright start. After Santi Cazorla had gone close with a dipping 30-yard strike Arsenal's attacks repeatedly broke down in the final third. Their failings in possession enabled Southampton to grow in confidence and the opening goal reflected their increasing ascendancy in the game. It followed a mix-up in the Gunners defence as both Bacary Sagna and Kieran Gibbs made a hash of their clearances, allowing Ramirez to fire a loose ball past Szczesny. Southampton should really have preserved their lead until half-time but were let down by a misjudgement from Brazilian Do Prado, who needlessly stretched out a leg at Walcott's free-kick from the left wing and diverted the ball past Artur Boruc. Do Prado set out to atone for his error after the break and drew a sharp save from Szczesny at his near post with a rasping drive from outside the area. His effort was the catalyst for another dominant spell from the home side in which Jason Puncheon lashed into the side netting from inside the box and Ramirez drilled a long-range effort over the bar. The Uruguayan was convinced he had given Southampton the lead midway through the half when he took a chipped pass on his chest and swivelled to fire home, but the goal was ruled out for a shove on Koscielny. Both managers made changes in a quest for a winning goal, with Arsenal substitute Gervinho firing into the side netting and Mikel Arteta going close from 25 yards. Puncheon then had a late chance to win the match for Southampton but he fired straight at Szczesny and the home side had to settle for a point.  Southampton manager Nigel Adkins: "It was a good performance. Arsenal have been scoring a shed load of goals and we nullified that threat and carried plenty of threat ourselves. "The own-goal was a spawny one that came off his toe but these things happen and we'll get the rub of the green soon. "They started brightly but we stuck out it, grew in confidence and played well."

24.04.2013 23:34:07 Manchester City had to be patient against a determined Stoke side but ran out comfortable winners to stay seven points behind Premier League leaders Manchester United. The Potters visited the Etihad Stadium on the back of a 10-game unbeaten run and with a game-plan of frustrating the champions. It was a tactic that worked for most of the first half until Pablo Zabaleta broke the deadlock and, from then on, the hosts were comfortable. Edin Dzeko gave Roberto Mancini's men breathing space after the break and Sergio Aguero sealed a one-sided win from a penalty awarded after Steven Nzonzi had fouled David Silva outside the box. The margin of victory was a welcome boost for Manchester City's goal difference, although United outscored them in their win at Wigan.  But in a week where he bemoaned his inability to sign Robin van Persie in the summer, Mancini will be cheered by the fact that, with his side scoring seven goals in their last two games, his strikers appear to be firing again. Only a late hamstring injury to Aguero, who was by far the home side's most effective attacking force from the first whistle, took the shine off their day. The game was barely a minute old when the Argentine striker met a James Milner cross but saw his shot blocked by Asmir Begovic at his near post. That set the tone for a first half that turned into an almost endless exercise of attack versus defence, with the champions unable to take their chances when they found a way through Stoke's massed defence. Aguero was wasteful when he fired over after running on to Gareth Barry's clipped pass but went a lot closer when he shaved the post with a header from another Barry delivery and saw a fizzing shot clawed away by Begovic. With the score still goalless, frustration among the home fans inside the Etihad Stadium was growing, although it was directed at Stoke's perceived time-wasting tactics rather than their own side's shortcomings in front of goal. It was Zabaleta who put the latter right just before half-time, taking advantage of some uncharacteristically poor Stoke defending to advance unchallenged from the right touchline with Milner, and tuck away the loose ball after Begovic blocked Milner's cross. The pattern of the game did not change after the break, with the title contenders still the only side who looked like scoring, and they did not take long to put the game beyond Stoke's reach. Dzeko, who had already crashed a dipping first-time shot over the bar, was in the right place to slot home when Begovic spilled Aguero's angled shot. Stoke, at last, ventured forward with intent and Joe Hart was forced into his first meaningful action of the game when he clawed away Charlie Adam's free-kick, before Jon Walters skewed a shot over from close range. The Potters' chances of a comeback still looked remote, however, and they were ended completely when Aguero made it 3-0 from the spot. There was still time for Glenn Whelan to force a late diving save from Hart, with the England keeper pushing his shot on to a post. But the only late drama at the Etihad Stadium was the injury to Aguero, who limped off late on. The champions can ill-afford to be without one of their most potent strikers for much of 2013.  Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini: "We played very well, like we played against Norwich and Sunderland, but sometimes it's not enough to play very well, it's important to score. "In the first half we deserved to score two or three goals, but it was difficult because Stoke is the best defence in the Premier League. "It was important to keep a clean sheet, because if we start to score and don't concede a goal we can have a chance to recover these points."  Stoke City manager Tony Pulis: "We've come here and played right at our maximum, and they've played below par. We didn't play as well as we can play, and they played well. "Sometimes you have to be a little bit grounded, not get carried away and look at facts and figures. When you have spent that much money on the quality they have, it's always difficult. "We've played Tottenham, Liverpool then Southampton with 10 men for the last 25 minutes so it's been tough. Coming here, against one of the best teams in the Premier League, the lads looked tired in the second half. They kept going, they had great spirit, great commitment and I'm not criticising them at all."

24.04.2013 23:34:07 Danny Graham scored a stoppage-time equaliser to deny Aston Villa victory at the Liberty Stadium. Christian Benteke appeared to have given Villa victory with an 85th-minute penalty after Nathan Dyer had fouled Andreas Weimann. But Graham fired home from eight yards to clinch a point for the hosts. Wayne Routledge's early strike had given Swansea the lead while Michu twice hit the post, before Weimann equalised before just half-time. The thrilling finale had seemed unlikely in the opening stages when Swansea, with top scorer Michu returning as one of five changes, cut Villa to shreds. But Villa, after conceding 15 goals in their previous three games, showed a fighting spirit which had been lacking over Christmas. Manager Paul Lambert's policy of giving youth a chance saw him select the youngest Villa team ever to take the field in the Premier League with an average age of just 23 years and 119 days. Swansea dominated the first half but went in at half-time all square after missing a host of good chances. Routledge fired the Swans ahead in the ninth minute with his second opening of the match, after good work by Leon Britton and Pablo Hernandez. Within a minute Michu hit the post and then Graham fired a left-foot shot wide when he should have scored. Michu produced a sublime drag-back inside the box to leave the Villa defence flat-footed, but goalkeeper Brad Guzan got enough on the shot to guide it onto the post. Then Swansea were caught against the run of play just before the interval. Benteke controlled well in midfield and his pass wrong-footed Ashley Williams to find Weimann, who fired a first-time shot low past Michel Vorm's outstretched right hand. It was Villa's first goal since their 3-1 win at Liverpool on 17 December. Villa had a let-off early in the second half when referee Mark Halsey ruled Joe Bennett handled the ball outside the box, though it was a close call. But Villa were showing a lot more fight than in recent weeks, with Marc Albrighton making a nuisance of himself and Bennett looking lively down the left flank. And Benteke and Weimann caused panic as Chico Flores failed to clear, but Weimann's shot was well wide. Dyer cleared a powerful Benteke header off the line, but the little winger brought down Weimann as he attempted to retrieve the ball and conceded the penalty. Benteke stepped up and sent Vorm the wrong way. The Swans threw everything at Villa in a bad-tempered finale, and finally got their reward when the ball fell to Graham eight yards out and he needed two attempts to beat Guzan with a powerful right-foot shot.  Swansea manager Michael Laudrup: "We could have been 4-0 up after 12 minutes. Incredible. "Aston Villa really fought after three defeats. They wanted to do everything to get a point and got close to getting three points. It was a great fight back from us, we showed character. We could have lost but should have won. "Obviously it should have been two penalties. The Aston Villa player had two feet on the line and last time I read the rules on the line is in the box. His  hand is also in the box so it should have been a penalty but that's life."  Aston Villa manager Paul Lambert: "It is hard to take because at 30 seconds to go, you expect to see it through. In the first half, Swansea were right on top but in the second half we were very good. "We have a lot of injuries so you have to give credit to the players. It is a big point for us. "I've got a lot of faith in what we're doing and we won't deviate from it. Even after the heavy defeats we were keeping spirits up."

24.04.2013 23:34:07 Tottenham moved up to third in the Premier League table as they claimed a deserved victory against Reading. The visitors went ahead when Pavel Pogrebnyak headed in a rebound after Ian Harte's free-kick hit the crossbar. But Spurs equalised only five minutes later, Michael Dawson with a diving header from Gylfi Sigurdsson's corner. Emmanuel Adebayor's powerful header from Aaron Lennon's cross put Tottenham ahead, before Clint Dempsey's deflected 25-yard effort sealed victory. Despite Spurs having 30 shots on goal compared to only seven from Reading, the Royals were left regretting their failure to score in a five-minute second-half spell. Pogrebynak had a shot saved by Hugo Lloris, a last-ditch challenge from Kyle Walker denied Jimmy Kebe and Dawson headed an Alex Pearce effort off the goal-line. Tottenham had been the only club in the Premier League not to have conceded a goal in the first 15 minutes of a match this season but that record ended as the visitors took a fourth-minute lead. Pogrebnyak was fouled by Mousa Dembele and Harte's curling free-kick from 25 yards hit the crossbar but the Russian striker reacted first to head his seventh goal of the season. However, Reading's lead did not last long as Dawson out-jumped two defenders to head in an equaliser. The Royals, one of three teams to not win an away Premier League game this season, had to defend for the rest of the half with lone striker Pogrebnyak working hard but seeing little of the ball as Spurs dominated. Jermain Defoe, who scored twice in Spurs' 3-1 win at the Madjeski Stadium in September, put an effort over the bar and later blasted a powerful shot wide. The visitors were hanging on as goalkeeper Adam Federici reacted to save a deflected shot from Sandro and also gathered Dembele's effort at the second attempt as Adebayor waited to pounce. Ex-Reading man Sigurdsson, who replaced the suspended Gareth Bale, also had a shot blocked and Dembele was unlucky to shoot narrowly wide. Spurs maintained their pressure early in the second half when Defoe was again denied by Federici. But the goalkeeper could do nothing as Tottenham took a deserved lead when Adebayor scored only his second Premier League goal of the season. Lennon got to the byline and dinked a cross to the back post where Adebayor beat Pearce in the air to power a header past Federici. Spurs, who have dropped points at home against West Brom, Norwich, Wigan and Stoke already this season, pushed for a third with Sandro, Lennon and Kyle Naughton all wasting chances. The hosts had dominated but nearly paid the price for their misses as Pogrebynak beat Jan Vertonghen and had two opportunities but Lloris made his only save of the game before Pogrebynak headed the rebound wide. Jimmy Kebe also had a late chance when he was denied by a last-ditch challenge before Dawson headed Pearce's effort off the line. But the home fans could relax when substitute Dempsey's shot took a huge deflection off Mikele Leigertwood with the ball looping up past Federici to seal Tottenham's win, their seventh in nine Premier League matches, while Reading remain 19th, five points adrift of safety.  Tottenham manager Andre Villas-Boas said:  "It was a difficult game in the beginning and the early goal gave them hope. "But we did well to close out the festive period with 10 points from four games and hopefully we will continue this form to put ourselves in the position we want to be. "Aaron Lennon is such a magnificent player and sometimes he does not get the recognition he deserves but his form has been extraordinary. He has been magnificent for us, scoring goals like last week, and is such a good player. "The three points have meant we have opened a bit of a gap over West Brom, Everton are still there and Arsenal have a fixture to play."  Reading manager Brian McDermott said:  "It was frustrating to concede an equaliser straight after scoring and if we could have had it at 1-0 at half-time then it would've been a really good game. "Even when they were 2-1 up we had three great opportunities and they scored a deflected goal to win it. "But at 2-1 we were right in it; their goalkeeper has made a decent save and Jimmy Kebe was denied by decent defending from Kyle Walker. "This is a really good Tottenham side that Andre has built here and not many people will come away from here taking points."

24.04.2013 23:34:07 Mark Noble's controversial early penalty set West Ham on their way to a comfortable victory which consigned Norwich to a fourth consecutive defeat. Noble calmly found the corner after three minutes when Ryan Bennett was deemed to have held down Winston Reid. Norwich almost levelled when a Robert Snodgrass free-kick hit the post but Joey O'Brien's shot made it 2-0. The hosts were largely untroubled after the break and secured the win despite Russell Martin's 90th-minute strike. Defender Martin's third goal in two games produced a nervy finale, but could not prevent the Hammers leapfrogging their visitors and moving up to 11th place in the Premier League table. The margin of victory - just West Ham's second in nine games - could have been far greater with Canaries goalkeeper Mark Bunn having to make several superb saves and the hosts also wasting a couple of glorious opportunities. But Norwich will point to the harsh second-minute penalty award as the catalyst for their demise. Three defeats in a row over Christmas had marred a 10-game unbeaten run for Norwich. And although all three of those losses were against sides in the top seven - including Manchester City and Chelsea - the last thing their fragile confidence needed was to be chasing the game within three minutes. But like the home reverse against City, that is exactly what happened. Their normally calm manager Chris Hughton was furious and bemused in equal measure as referee Mark Clattenburg penalised Bennett for grabbing Reid's shirt as a looping ball was played into the box. Reid seemed to be impeding Bennett just as as much but Noble ignored the protests and stayed cool to convert the spot-kick and put the hosts ahead. Norwich refused to be rattled, but a side deprived of both injured main strikers Grant Holt and Steve Morison struggled to create chances. Despite a willing display from on-loan Tottenham teenager Harry Kane, they lacked punch and presence up front and West Ham cleverly stifled the main creative threat from the ever-lively Wes Hoolahan. Snodgrass was desperately unlucky with a brilliant 20-yard free-kick that hit the post with the score at 1-0, and they appealed for penalties of their own when the ball hit Reid on the arm, and then after the break when Kane tumbled in the box under a challenge from James Tomkins. But West Ham, with Noble in dominant form and midfield partner Jack Collison equally impressive on his first start this season, played with a greater tempo and created the majority of the chances. Bunn pulled off a breathtaking one-handed reaction stop to keep out Collison's effort just before the hosts made it 2-0 when O'Brien continued his run into the box to sidefoot home from 10 yards after great work by Noble. Norwich appealed for a foul by Carlton Cole on Alex Tettey in the build up but Clattenburg waved play on, much to Hughton's disgust. Matthew Taylor's fierce 20-yard strike then forced a save from Bunn before the otherwise impressive Cole produced a terrible miss when he somehow skied the ball over the bar from three yards after a fabulous move on the right involving Noble and Guy Demel. West Ham sat deeper after the break and Norwich saw much more of the ball but were still unable to create much. Kane appealed hopefully after tumbling when racing through on goal while at the other end the Hammers almost added a third goal when Ricardo Vaz Te's header hit the post. But West Ham did not need the security of a third despite Martin pulling a goal back with just over 30 seconds of normal time remaining when he did brilliantly to volley into the corner of the net from substitute Elliott Bennett's right-wing cross.  West Ham manager Sam Allardyce:  "I was wondering if we were going to hold our confidence and performance level at home. It has been really good even though we have had two back-to-back defeats. They showed they have the mentality to cope with whatever is thrown at them. "We are glad that their goal didn't come a bit earlier but it's a shame the score did not reflect how well we played. We should have scored a few more and and we did it with really good football. We deserved the win. "Often in a crowded penalty box it is impossible to give penalties like that, but I could see it from where I was in the dugout. That early goal gave us the confidence to go on. "The disappointing thing was the chances the front lads missed, with balls just flashing across the box needed a tap in. "We lost a goal in the 90th minute which made us edgy in the end when we should have been out of sight. We will continue to try to brush up on our finishing techniques with the lads and hope the next time round we are more clinical with our finishing."  Norwich City boss Chris Hughton:  "The key decisions in the game did not go in our favour, but we did not start well enough. "We accept Ryan Bennett had hold of the lad's shirt, but I also saw Reid's forearm in Ryan's chest. They are very close, he is not pulling Reid so he cannot get away, it is something you see game in and game out right throughout the country. "On almost every occasion you do not see a penalty, particularly when it is so early in the game, so I was very surprised when he gave it. "I also don't accept it was not a foul on Alex Tettey leading up to the second goal and certainly was a handball in the first half and then the incident on Harry Kane. We have been on the end of poor decisions. "We showed in the second half a bit more of what we are about. Nobody has really given us a beating and they have all been really close games. We have to be at our best to get results and we have been close in the last four games."

24.04.2013 23:34:07 Javier Hernandez and Robin van Persie scored twice as Premier League leaders Manchester United coasted past Wigan to preserve their seven-point advantage. The Mexican striker side-footed the opener after Ali Al Habsi had parried Patrice Evra's shot into his path. United went 2-0 up when Van Persie turned Ivan Ramis and curled a sublime shot into the far corner. Hernandez lashed home Van Persie's deflected free-kick before the Dutchman turned in Danny Welbeck's low cross. United's eighth win in nine league games maintained their grip on top spot in the table at the end of a busy Christmas schedule and provided a fitting way for manager Sir Alex Ferguson to celebrate turning 71 on New Year's Eve. Wigan, in contrast, appear destined for their annual relegation fight after sliding to 17th place, just one point above the drop zone. A lively start from United showed their determination to avoid a repeat of last April, when a shock 1-0 defeat at the DW Stadium contributed to them surrendering an eight-point lead to Manchester City in the title race and set Wigan on the road to safety. The recalled Hernandez was a lively spearhead to United's attack and, after firing his first chance straight at Al Habsi from a narrow angle, he collected a Ryan Giggs pass and drilled into the net, only to be correctly denied by the linesman's flag. Another sublime delivery from Giggs almost provided Hernandez with a tap-in, but the ball was expertly whipped away from his toes by Maynor Figueroa. With United in the ascendancy, Al Habsi was the busiest man on the field, saving a free-kick from Van Persie and a deflected drive from Rafael. But when a corner from the right was never properly cleared, United's pressure finally bore fruit. Evra picked up Jonny Evans's pass and unleashed a powerful drive, which was pushed one-handed by Al Habsi into the path of Hernandez, who side-footed first time into the roof of the net. Al Habsi could do nothing to prevent United's second goal, which was down to the individual brilliance of Van Persie. Found by Hernandez inside the area, the former Arsenal striker left Ramis on the floor with a sharp turn and whipped a right-footed shot into the net. United almost extended their lead shortly after the restart as Van Persie played Hernandez into space but the striker fired wastefully wide. Wigan thought they had secured a lifeline when Arouna Kone turned in Franco Di Santo's low cross, but the Ivory Coast striker was ruled to have strayed a fraction offside. United reacted to the scare with characteristic ruthlessness as Hernandez secured the points with his team's third goal. Van Persie's free-kick rebounded off the wall into the Mexican's path and was expertly drilled past Al Habsi. A comfortable afternoon for United was complete when Van Persie capitalised on a horrible mix-up in the home side's defence to score his 19th goal of the season. Jean Beausejour ran into his team-mate Emmerson Boyce and presented the ball to substitute Welbeck, whose square pass was easily turned in by the prolific Dutchman.

24.04.2013 23:34:07 Dimitar Berbatov and Alex Kacaniklic scored as Fulham claimed only their second away win of the season against high-flying West Brom. Berbatov put the Cottagers ahead with a low strike before Romelu Lukaku equalised just after the break with a close-range effort. Lukaku and Zoltan Gera both hit the post for the Baggies. But Kacaniklic secured the deserved win for the visitors after a clever ball from Bryan Ruiz set up his low strike. It has certainly been a very different first half of the season for these two sides as West Brom fly high under the tutelage of Steve Clarke with their highest-ever points tally for this time of the year. On the contrary, Martin Jol's side had won only one game in the last 12 before this after a promising start to the campaign and only earned one victory on their travels so far this season - at Wigan in September. However, they got their second away win here and it was Jol's side who got off to the better start with the early pressure as Steve Sidwell flashed a shot over the bar. It was a subdued New Year's Day atmosphere early on at The Hawthorns, even when Gareth McAuley headed wide for the hosts and Lukaku had a close-range effort blocked. Berbatov was pulling the strings for Fulham but wasted a great chance on the half-hour mark when he hit a lazy effort well over after West Brom's Chris Brunt failed to clear. However, Berbatov showed his real class to get his seventh goal of the season. His long pass out wide sent Ashkan Dejagah down the right before the Bulgarian trotted to the edge of the area to receive the ball back from his team-mate before sliding his shot through Ben Foster's legs. West Brom were level within moments of the restart as Billy Jones took advantage of some poor defending down the right as he weaved into space before crossing for Lukaku who turned the ball home - although the on-loan Chelsea striker may have been offside. After the drab opening half, this was a pulsating start to the second period and Lukaku struck the outside of the post when Aaron Hughes failed to clear. The Baggies striker then forced a good stop from Fulham goalkeeper David Stockdale before former Cottager Zoltan Gera struck the post on the rebound and then Hughes headed away the following effort from Brunt. Fulham were back ahead in the 58th minute as Ruiz's superb ball put Kacaniklic in and he turned McAuley and Jones on the edge of the area before coolly sliding the ball under Foster. Only Stoke and Manchester City had left this ground with three points this term before this result and second-half substitute Shane Long tried to preserve West Brom's record but his stoppage-time flick from close range was saved by Stockdale.  West Brom manager Steve Clarke: "I don't think we played as we can do. First half we were way off the mark. I'm not sure if it was the consequence of four games in 10 days or not. "In the second half it was better, we did the hard work to get back into it but then we gave it away. We could not quite get the second equaliser. "Nobody can question the character of the team. Right at the death, with a bit of luck, we would have got the goal that our second-half performance deserved."  Fulham manager Martin Jol: "To win against a West Brom side who are flying - that is a great way to start the new year. "I was very happy with the performance from everyone. If you lose games and don't do well, Berbatov is the first to get criticised because of his body language but I can assure you he always wants to win. "I thought overall for the boys it was good for our confidence because we were struggling results wise. Our away record is not fantastic but this is our second win and we should have won maybe three of the four draws."

24.04.2013 23:34:07 Arsenal's four-match winning run ended with a goalless draw against Everton, a result that did neither side much good in their Champions League quest. The Toffees, who were fortunate not to have Darron Gibson sent off, started brightly and went close through Steven Pienaar and the lively Ross Barkley. Olivier Giroud was wasteful for Arsenal, now two points clear of fifth-placed Spurs having played a game more. Giroud was denied by Seamus Coleman's clearance as Everton secured a point. The Toffees thoroughly deserved a draw in what was a fiercely contested encounter, and are now unbeaten in six league games. But David Moyes' side, now within two points of fourth-placed Chelsea but having played two games more, were unable to find the goal that would have really improved their prospects of playing in next season's Champions League. Nor is Arsenal's own top-four place by any means guaranteed and they will need to start more quickly when Manchester United visit on 28 April than in their last two matches at the Emirates Stadium. The Gunners conspicuously failed to carry on where they had left off in their previous match, when Arsene Wenger's men scored three goals in the final five minutes to secure a 3-1 victory over Norwich.  Former Toffees midfielder Mikel Arteta, Aaron Ramsey and Jack Wilshere struggled to get a grip in midfield as the visitors' Pienaar skied a glorious chance from Coleman's excellent seventh-minute pass. Everton boss Moyes opted to start 19-year-old Barkley in place of injured England midfielder Leon Osman for this crucial game and the teenager typified his team's battling first-half display, playing with a maturity beyond his years. In a bruising encounter, Wilshere was left clutching a sore ankle after falling awkwardly following a fair challenge with Barkley. Everton midfielder Gibson was then fortunate to escape a red card when he was penalised for a cynical foul on Theo Walcott shortly after he had been booked for bringing down the England international. Arsenal, chasing a seventh win in eight top-flight games, struggled to hurt their opponents, and were restricted to just a couple of chances in the first half, full-back Kieran Gibbs failing to take advantage of Marouane Fellaini's 24th-minute botched clearance, and Giroud missing from close range after a fine pass by Ramsey. Wenger's side improved after the interval but still could not find the breakthrough, although Santi Cazorla forced a fine save from Tim Howard with a powerful attempt after Gibbs had nodded the ball into his path. In an end-to-end game, the tireless Barkley went close with a curling right-foot attempt before Coleman stopped Giroud from sliding the Gunners into a late lead following a surging run by Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain.  Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger:  "We should have won the game, but it still keeps us in a strong position in the race for the top four. "I felt that in the first half the referee didn't deal at all well with the intimidating physical challenges, but that we responded well to the physicality. "It was detrimental to the fluency of our game, but we kept going, had good concentration. "You have to respect the effort Everton put in. They decided to make it very physical for us to disturb our game and sometimes went a little bit over the edge, but the referee had to make the right decision."  Everton manager David Moyes:  "We went to try and win it. We knew if we got three points we would have a real chance (of the top four), but a point keeps us ticking along. "I think the result suits Spurs more than anybody, but I don't think we are out of place where we are. "I would take it (the Europa League), but I am going to try and get the Champions League - if we are still getting that mention in mid-April, then it is not bad for Everton."

24.04.2013 23:34:07 A woeful QPR display intensified their relegation fears as they were beaten by a Luis Suarez-inspired Liverpool.  Reds' boss Brendan Rodgers was absent from the game with a bug but Suarez twice capitalised on poor defending to put the visitors 2-0 ahead. QPR were denied a penalty when Adel Taarabt's free-kick hit the arm of Jordan Henderson, before Daniel Agger headed in Liverpool's third. Steven Gerrard's shot was cleared off QPR's goal-line as the Reds won easily. Bottom-of-the-table QPR tamely went down to a 12th league defeat in 20 games this season and had the air of a side resigned to relegation, with eight points separating them from safety. They had seen fellow bottom three sides Reading win and Southampton draw on Saturday and, while the least QPR might have showed is the stomach for a survival fight, they were missing that quality to an alarming scale. Liverpool were quicker, hungrier and stronger and, although they were allowed the freedom to dominate the game, they did so with some delightful play which should help Rodgers feel better. The livewire and menacing Suarez was again key to their win and he put his side 2-0 up in the first 16 minutes. He jinked past a defender and had a 20-yard shot parried away, before giving his side the lead when he eased past centre-back Clint Hill and slotted a shot into the bottom corner. The Uruguayan's second came when his low cross was cleared back to him by the sliding Nedum Onuoha to leave Suarez to side-foot in his 13th league goal of the season. QPR playmaker Taarabt had a fair shout for a penalty when his free-kick hit the arm of Henderson, although referee Anthony Taylor was unmoved. But QPR were crumbling against the endeavour and quality of the visitors and conceded a third when Agger headed in Gerrard's cross. Soon after, Suarez shrugged off defenders Onuoha and Ryan Nelsen, before teeing up Gerrard - whose shot was cleared off the goal-line. QPR fans booed their side off at half-time and their side continued to be outplayed after the break. A Suarez shot was well saved by Julio Cesar, while Henderson shot high. QPR midfielder Stephane Mbia curled a rare shot wide but the efforts came way too late. The home side were 2-0 down with 13 minutes left against Liverpool last season before rescuing a 3-2 win which kick-started them beating the drop. There was no such turnaround this time around, with Chelsea and Tottenham next up in the top flight for the Loftus Road club.  Liverpool assistant manager Colin Pascoe:  "That's probably the best we have played for a long time with the display in the first half. The way we took our chances was pleasing. "Luis Suarez is superb. He's a maverick. He creates chances for himself, finishes them and is a great lad. "It was great result from the lads and the way we performed in the first half secured the win. We were disappointed with the defeat by Stoke on Boxing Day and the response from the players was terrific."

24.04.2013 23:34:07 Frank Lampard served a timely reminder of his goal-scoring ability as his double carried Chelsea back to third with a hard-earned win over Everton. The 34-year-old, who is out of contract in the summer, headed in Ramires' cross and stabbed in from close range after his side had conceded in 62 seconds. Steven Pienaar gave Everton an early lead, following in after Victor Anichebe nodded against the post. Nikica Jelavic hit the bar and missed a late chance as the hosts fell short. Chelsea's fourth successive league win under interim boss Rafael Benitez, after failing to win in his first three, means the Blues finish 2012 four points off Manchester City and 11 off leaders Manchester United, but with a game in hand on both. Whether Lampard finishes 2013 with the Stamford Bridge club remains in doubt, with the England midfielder free to agree pre-contract terms with a foreign club in January. For all the promise of Oscar and Eden Hazard and the undoubted ability of Juan Mata, Chelsea's travelling fans made it clear that they believed that it is to soon to consign Lampard, who joined the club 11 and a half years ago, to Chelsea history. His goals brought to an end Everton's formidable unbeaten run at Goodison, which stretched back 14 previous games to March's 1-0 defeat by Arsenal.  The home team certainly settled into the match like a team at ease in their surroundings, scoring with their first attack. In the absence of Seamus Coleman and Phil Neville, Phil Jagielka roamed forward from his unaccustomed right-back spot to deliver a cross that Anichebe nodded against the woodwork. Pienaar gleefully dispatched low past Petr Cech. With the South African and his midfield partner Leon Osman weaving dangerously in the spaces between David Luiz and Lampard, Everton continued to pen Chelsea back after the opener. Jelavic smacked the post with a free-kick after he and Pienaar had hustled Gary Cahill out of possession - and Osman's first-time effort demanded a smart save from Cech. The home fans revelled in their early dominance, taunting Fernando Torres and Rafael Benitez, so long Liverpool figureheads, on their return to Merseyside. But it was the third of Chelsea's Spanish contingent - Mata - who looked likeliest to silence a boisterous Goodison. A last-ditch block from Johnny Heitinga denied the former Valencia man, before his probing prised apart Everton again; Ashley Cole inches away from turning in from Cesar Azpilicueta's subsequent cross. Chelsea's equaliser capped a spell of pressure and ensured Lampard a Premier League haul of five or more goals for the 16th successive season. Manager David Moyes could not inspire a repeat of Everton's rollicking start to the match as Chelsea, despite the half-time withdrawal of Cech with an ankle injury, started better after the break. Torres drifted dangerously into space behind Leighton Baines but mis-controlled Luiz's pass, strayed offside to ruin a delicious move, and had a sweetly struck snap-shot from 20 yards saved by Tim Howard. Without the presence of Marouane Fellaini, who was serving the final game of a three-match ban, Everton struggled to capitalise on the industry and invention of Pienaar and Baines down the left. The one time that Jelavic met a Baines delivery, his stooping header beat substitute goalkeeper Ross Turnbull but not the bar. Three minutes later Chelsea were in front for the first time. Mata was instrumental, crossing for Hazard to nod down before Lampard instinctively volleyed home after the Spaniard's initial effort had been palmed back into the six-yard box. Jelavic squandered a fine chance to level in injury-time, swiping thin air as he attempted to smash home a Baines cross, but Chelsea could have already made the game safe when Sylvain Distin stretched to intervene as Torres bore down on Howard in the final minute.  Everton manager David Moyes : "We're not disappointed because we played really well and we've run the European champions really close. but we didn't quite have enough in the end. "We had played well enough to get a second goal but had been unfortunate, having shots back off the woodwork. "I thought we were a bit unlucky. We tried to make what we had work the best we could today and for long periods I thought we did."

24.04.2013 23:34:07 Theo Walcott scored three goals and set up two more as Arsenal overcame Newcastle in a 10-goal thriller and climbed to fifth in the Premier League. Walcott, out of contract in the summer, swept Arsenal in front but Demba Ba equalised with a deflected free-kick. After Sylvain Marveaux tapped in to cancel out Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's low shot, Lukas Podolski nodded home. Ba levelled again, only for Walcott to score twice more, either side of a brace from substitute Olivier Giroud. Giroud hit the bar as Arsenal pushed for an eighth, but the result was secure and Arsenal extended their winning run to four games. Emirates Stadium was engulfed by chants of "sign him up" as the full-time whistle approached, a reference to Walcott's contract dispute. He has scored 14 goals in all competitions this season and four in three games since being deployed as the central striker. His first effort, in particular, carried shades of Thierry Henry - Arsenal's record goalscorer who was watching from the stands and is training with the club during the Major League Soccer off-season. It is hard to imagine Arsenal letting the 23-year-old leave if he continues to produce performances of this level. Walcott left Newcastle stunned but while they are still without an away league win this term, they should take heart from impressive displays at Manchester United and Arsenal over the festive period. They had four days less than Arsenal to prepare - the Gunners' Boxing Day visit of West Ham was postponed - yet enjoyed plenty of early possession and Ba headed just over from Marveaux's corner. Newcastle were punished for a high defensive line when Walcott latched on to Podolski's through ball and curled past Tim Krul - but Alan Pardew's men responded well and were rewarded. Bacary Sagna conceded a needless free-kick outside the box and Ba's set piece took a heavy deflection off Jack Wilshere to elude Szczesny. After half-time Podolski nodded Danny Simpson's throw to Santi Cazorla and he set up Oxlade-Chamberlain to drill past Krul, only for Gabriel Obertan to beat Sagna and cross for Marveaux to tap in. The momentum was shifting like a pendulum and no sooner had Podolski headed Arsenal back in front after Wilshere's run and cross than Newcastle struck again for 3-3. A weaving run from the outstanding Marveaux ended with a cross to the back post that let Ba ghost past Kieran Gibbs and convert. Despite Pardew signalling to his players that they must not concede again, his message went unheeded as Walcott clipped his second. The introduction of Giroud gave Arsenal a new dimension and the Frenchman headed in a Walcott cross before drilling past Krul. With Newcastle tiring, Walcott shimmied his way past several defenders to chip Krul from a tight angle and seal his hat-trick.  Newcastle boss Alan Pardew: "We have given away soft goals and the match has got away from us. It was a heavy pitch at Old Trafford and we looked leggy after our exertions there. "We did not have the energy to cope with them in the last 20 minutes. We put the ball at risk too often and some of the goals we gave away were not good enough for us. "There was a clear difference between the two sides in the last part of the match. We got overrun, but we have to defend as a team. I don't want to put all the focus on the defence and the back four." On whether Demba Ba will leave the club: "It will be what it will be. There is nothing we can do about that - the clause is there and that is that."

24.04.2013 23:34:07 Wigan Athletic moved out of the Premier League relegation zone and above Aston Villa with an emphatic victory over their struggling hosts. Wigan made the perfect start when Ivan Ramis escaped his marker to meet Jean Beausejour's corner with a firm header. Brett Holman smashed a half-volley against the crossbar as Villa briefly threatened before the interval. Emmerson Boyce calmly slotted in after a superb one-two with Arouna Kone, who added the third from a tight angle. Hordes of frustrated Villa supporters headed for the exits immediately after Kone completed a routine win that lifts the Latics above Villa into 16th place. It was another difficult afternoon for Paul Lambert's men, who have endured a nightmare Christmas period with heavy defeats against Chelsea and Tottenham.  Most of the pre-match talk centred on how their young side, with an average age of 23, would react to conceding 12 goals in their previous two matches. But they made the worst possible start by conceding their 13th goal in just 183 minutes - after being let down by basic defensive errors at a Wigan set-piece. The visitors' central defender Ramis, making his first start since late November following a hamstring injury, easily escaped his marker Christian Benteke and took advantage with a powerful eight-yard header from Beausejour's left-wing corner. The Latics grew in confidence, stroking the ball around as a leaderless-looking Villa chased after their visitors, but Wigan failed to stretch home keeper Brad Guzan again before half-time, despite creating a number of decent opportunities to double their lead. Wigan midfielder Shaun Maloney appealed for a penalty after he felt he was impeded by Villa's Stephen Ireland and also fired over from Beausejour's pull-back following the Chilean winger's clever run down the left. The hosts finally managed to build some sustained pressure as half-time loomed, Benteke drilling low into the net with the flag already raised against an offside Andreas Weimann. And they should have been level at the break when Joe Bennett's deep free-kick was nodded down by Benteke to the far post where Holman's effort beat Al Habsi but hit the crossbar. Villa started the second half by creating another opportunity which Benteke headed over but within six minutes they were further behind, Latics defender Boyce bursting through the Villa midfield before stylishly finishing past Guzan after exchanging one-touch passes with Kone. It was killer blow for an already demoralised Villa and Wigan, who had not won in their previous six matches, capitalised on the hosts' fragile confidence with a third goal. Kone, recently called up by Ivory Coast for their Africa Cup of Nations squad having missed the past two tournaments, brushed aside a weak challenge from Matthew Lowton to race on to Franco Di Santo's pass and round Guzan before converting. Villa's dismal day ended with those home fans still inside the half-empty Villa Park ironically cheering substitute Jordan Bowery's late shot on target - though there was some solace as Stoke's late equaliser against Southampton at least stopped them sliding into the bottom three.  Wigan manager Roberto Martinez:  "I felt from the first second the players were really focused. It was very important for us to keep a clean sheet but what they did going forward was first-class. "The movement was very precise and the penetration was very good. I thought we could have got a few more goals if that final pass was cuter. "It is not just the win against Aston Villa which is important - it's the three points we wanted. "You can't think anything until you reach 40 points, but today is a massive, massive boost."

24.04.2013 23:34:07 Swansea recorded their first win in five Premier League games, as Fulham slipped closer to the relegation zone with just two victories in the last three months. Danny Graham, playing in place of injured top scorer Michu up front, gave the visitors a first-half lead, before Jonathan de Guzman made it two. Bryan Ruiz got one back after a scramble on the goal line. But it was not enough, leaving Fulham with just one win in their last 12. Swansea kept up their unbeaten record against Fulham in the Premier League, having done the double over them last season. It also maintained their unique record of winning all six of the games in which they have opened the scoring this season. For Swansea, this was proof there is life without talisman Spanish talisman Michu and Graham made the most of his return to the side with his goal. But Fulham's goalkeeper David Stockdale had a game he would rather forget as two errors were pounced on by the Welsh side. Striker Dimitar Berbatov had the first clear-cut chance to put the home side ahead but he scuffed his kick just inside the six-yard box from a corner and the ball flew over the crossbar. Swansea then took the lead against the run of play when Stockdale made a meal of a relatively easy cross from winger Nathan Dyer, with Graham on hand to score his first Premier League goal since August. Fulham nearly drew level moments later, midfielder Kerim Frei flashing his left-foot strike across goal when he really should have tested Swansea's German goalkeeper Gerhard Tremmel. Tremmel was called into action again towards the end of the half when he parried a left-foot strike by Fulham's Ruiz around his right-hand post. Ruiz had another chance to bring the hosts level just after the break as Tremmel could only watch the Costa Rican's free-kick fly past the post. But Martin Jol's team soon found themselves 2-0 down after Stockdale's clearance hit defender Brede Hangeland and De Guzman pounced. The home side finally scored when Ruiz found the back of the net after the ball broke to him from a Berbatov shot that came back off the bar, the goal going in off Sacha Riether, who Swansea protested was standing offside. Berbatov thought he had levelled when he was first to a Ruiz shot parried by Tremmel but the Bulgarian striker was offside.

24.04.2013 23:34:07 Manchester United will start 2013 with a seven-point lead at the top of the Premier League table after a hard-earned win over West Bromwich Albion. Gareth McAuley deflected Ashley Young's cross past Ben Foster for the opening goal at a rain-lashed Old Trafford. Foster tipped a Young effort onto the bar, before West Brom's Gabriel Tamas wasted a great close-range chance. But United substitute Robin van Persie sealed victory with a curling finish in the 90th minute. This was not as comfortable for United as the scoreline might suggest, with the leaders forced to weather a spirited second-half  display from the Baggies. Nevertheless the outcome was a welcome early birthday present for Sir Alex Ferguson, who is 71 on Monday. The United manager starts the new year with a 13th Premier League title firmly within his sights after his side ended a trophyless 2012 with a victory sprinkled with positives. Shinji Kagawa, back from a knee injury, was influential in his first appearance since October while captain Nemanja Vidic helped United to only their fourth Premier League clean sheet of the season. Ferguson could even afford to start with Van Persie on the bench ahead of Tuesday's match at Wigan Athletic. If there were any grumblings from the home dressing room it was that they forced their fans to endure a tense second half after struggling to add to their early lead until Van Persie's arrival. West Brom deserve praise for the way they reacted after falling behind, with Steve Clarke's side showing why they arrived in Manchester in sixth place in the table. Despite the soggy conditions United passed it around in their usual effortless style. And the hosts broke the deadlock in the ninth minute when McAuley diverted Young's low cross into his own net after Graham Dorrans gifted United possession with a careless clearance. Young, one of five players recalled to the United side, then unleashed a powerful drive from 16 yards which Foster did well to tip onto his bar. Michael Carrick was denied by Tamas's clearance off the line before half-time yet the West Brom player was guilty of a glaring miss during his team's best period after the interval. The Romanian defender was presented with a glorious chance to equalise from close range but instead headed the ball away from the United goal. Peter Odemwingie also went close in front of the Stretford End before Van Persie completed the scoring with a delightful 90th-minute finish. Three days earlier Ferguson had berated the match officials during his side's narrow win over Newcastle but this time he celebrated from the touchline as Van Persie curled the ball over Foster from the edge of the area for his 14th league goal of the season.  Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson:  "He (Robin van Persie) is a fantastic player. He came on and changed the game for us. "Every time the ball came up to him he got hold of it and turned on them. They were having to go back to their box all the time and he has done well. "West Brom were a very resilient, stubborn team. They worked really hard on their defending and closed all their ranks. "You have to deal with that but the slowness of the pitch killed our speed a bit."  West Brom manager Steve Clarke:  "The fact they had to bring some of their big guns off the bench shows how well we were doing. "In the first half we were too timid. "We spoke at half-time about being too respectful and in the end, the scoreline doesn't reflect the way we played."

24.04.2013 23:34:07 Ten-man Manchester City held off a determined Norwich to win a pulsating game at Carrow Road. City surged ahead when Edin Dzeko twice slotted home in the first four minutes. Anthony Pilkington's free-kick gave Norwich hope but, despite the visitors having Samir Nasri sent off, Sergio Aguero added a third for the champions. Norwich's Russell Martin scored twice either side of a Dzeko shot that went in off the post and keeper Mark Bunn, as the visitors clung on for victory. The champions, beaten at Sunderland on Boxing Day, were made to demonstrate their appetite to retain their Premier League title with a victory achieved despite the handicap of losing Nasri to a straight red card on the stroke of half-time. The French winger and Sebastian Bassong squared up to each other after a strong tackle from the latter took both the ball and Nasri, who reacted angrily and appeared to flick his head towards the Canaries defender - though the visitors were clearly aggrieved at what they regarded as a very harsh decision. The talk following the shock defeat at the Stadium of Light had all been about Manchester City's misfiring strikeforce, and their forwards seemed to have taken the criticism to heart judging by the rampant start at Carrow Road. The first goal was beautifully worked as Aguero picked out David Silva on the edge of the area and he slipped a first-time pass to Dzeko, who sent a shot into the bottom corner. Norwich barely had time to regroup before their opponents added a second. Canaries keeper Bunn was tempted out of his goal in an unsuccessful attempt to close down Aguero, who laid the ball back for Dzeko to slot into an empty net. Norwich complained about a challenge from Vincent Kompany on Bradley Johnson in the build-up to the goal but it was allowed to stand. The visitors were then almost gifted a third when home defender Javier Garrido's poor backpass was tipped over the crossbar by a backtracking Bunn. But the Canaries have beaten Arsenal and Manchester United at Carrow Road this season and they responded with Pilkington's 20-yard free-kick, which found the net via a deflection off Gael Clichy. Down to 10 men, Roberto Mancini's side restored their two-goal lead after half-time when Aguero raced on to a Yaya Toure ball before classily dinking the ball over Bunn. But the home side pressed forward undeterred, Jonathan Howson having a shot palmed wide by keeper Joe Hart. From the resulting corner, a Robert Snodgrass cross was nodded back across goal by Bassong and Martin was on hand to guide in a header and reduce the deficit to one again. The visitors might have thought they had put the match out of reach when Dzeko's fierce drive came back off the post and hit keeper Bunn on its way into the net but Norwich were still not finished, Martin grabbing his second when he diverted a Bradley Johnson shot into the net following a goalmouth scramble after 75 minutes. Mancini's men managed to keep Norwich at bay for the remainder of the game and remain seven points adrift of leaders Manchester United in second.  Norwich manager Chris Hughton:  "Manchester City showed why they spend the amount of money they do for the offensive players they have, but you can't be 2-0 down so early on and expect to have a good day. "However, we displayed great character and certainly at 4-3 it seemed it might be going our way, but again they showed real good quality. "I cannot fault the endeavour of the players we have got, so now we will look to go again."

24.04.2013 23:34:07 Reading earned only their second Premier League win of the season as Pavel Pogrebnyak's fifth-minute goal  secured a vital win over West Ham. Pogrebnyak latched onto a poor backpass from Hammers defender James Collins, before beating Jussi Jaaskelainen. Adam Federici tipped Collins's header over while Jem Karacan's shot was pushed onto the bar by Jaaskelainen. Substitute Ricardo Vaz Te nodded wide from three yards as the hosts held on to move within five points of safety. The result means the Royals remain a place above bottom side QPR on 13 points, with Southampton (17 points) and Aston Villa (18) above them.  Reading beat West Ham twice last season in the Championship and they made a flying start to the game, Pogrebnyak giving them the lead after just five minutes. Collins under hit a backpass to goalkeeper Jaaskelainen and the Russian intercepted the ball, slotting home beautifully for the opener. The goal settled Reading, who dominated midfield in the opening stages with Jimmy Kebe on the right wing their best outlet. West Ham slowly started to come into the game, threatening with crosses from wider positions, and Collins almost made amends for his earlier mistake with a close-range header that was superbly tipped over the bar by Federici. Nolan also tested the Australian keeper with a curling effort from the edge of the area, while Reading needed several heroic tackles from central defender Alex Pearce to keep West Ham at bay. It was a half low on quality and full of poor challenges, with Mark Noble, Pogrebnyak and Collins all booked, and another four yellow cards following in the second half. Carlton Cole had West Ham's first chance after the break, heading Matt Jarvis's cross wide as the visitors introduced Jack Collison for Matt Taylor to try to give them a grip in midfield. Cole was involved again soon after, stamping on Chris Gunter, with the Hammers forward lucky to escape punishment. As the rain lashed down it became a gruelling battle, with Reading dropping deeper and deeper as they looked to hold on. Collison went close with a low strike that Federici did well to keep out at full stretch, and Karacan crashed a shot against the crossbar from 18 yards. Vaz Te made his return after 12 weeks out with a shoulder injury. And the Portuguese had a great opportunity to level the game but headed wide when unmarked three yards out.  Reading manager Brian McDermott told BBC Sport:  "I'm very pleased. We were very resilient today and we needed to be. We know what we have to do to get results in this league and we move on now and look forward to our next game against Spurs. "We had to deal with facing a very physical side and we have kept another clean sheet. I didn't feel they had too many opportunities. Pavel took his chance very well and we've also hit the bar. "A couple of their players could have been sent off and you saw two teams desperate to win out there."  West Ham manager Sam Allardyce told BBC Sport:  "We shot ourselves in the foot from the early stages. James Collins has been solid for us this season but he made a basic error and they took full advantage. "Reading defended deep and in numbers and Vaz Te has missed a glaring, glaring chance and two errors mean we have not taken any points against them. "We are slipping back down that way now and that is going to put pressure on us. We should have undone our early error but Vaz has missed it. "We are bitterly disappointed not to come away with a point and now we are without James (Collins) and Kevin (Nolan) through suspension for an important game against Norwich."

24.04.2013 23:34:07 Cameron Jerome's stunning late equaliser denied Southampton and preserved 10-man Stoke's unbeaten record. Substitute Jerome lashed into the top corner from 30 yards to rescue City after a poor first-half display saw them slip 3-1 behind. Three times Saints took advantage of confusion in a City defence that was without suspended pair Ryan Shawcross and Geoff Cameron. Rickie Lambert opened the scoring at the far post and, after Kenwyne Jones' backheeled equaliser, Jay Rodriguez profited from a mix-up, with Andy Wilkinson turning into his own net for the third. The visitors should have made the game safe early in the second half, only for Guly do Prado to miss from the edge of the 18-yard box with the Stoke goal unguarded. It was to prove a crucial moment as, soon after, Matthew Upson scrambled home from a corner. With Stoke down to 10 following Steven Nzonzi's red card for a studs-up challenge on Jack Cork, Jerome produced his moment of brilliance to extend their unbeaten run to 10 games. It was perhaps cruel on Saints, who fully deserved their half-time lead, but Stoke can justifiably claim they deserved a point for the way they battled in a second half. They had two penalty appeals turned down when Jose Fonte and Maya Yoshida appeared to have handled. The Potters may be concerned, though, at the way the tightest defence in the Premier League was so easily breached without the presence of Cameron and, more importantly, Shawcross. Nigel Adkins opted to partner Lambert with Rodriguez up front and, with Do Prado and Jason Puncheon impressing on the flanks, the Southampton manager's positive approach was vindicated. Saints deservedly took the lead as Do Prado turned Ryan Shotton - in for Cameron at right-back - and crossed for Lambert to get ahead of Wilkinson and slot home. Stoke hit back almost immediately, with Shotton making amends to jink past Luke Shaw and square for Jones, whose cool backheel crept inside Kelvin Davis's far post. But, from there, Stoke fell apart. First Lambert had time to collect a long ball, turn and float a cross into the box. Goalkeeper Asmir Begovic looked to have it covered, only for Robert Huth to deflect the ball onto his own bar, with Rodriguez able to tap into the empty net. It got worse for the Potters when Puncheon collected the ball from a corner and delivered a cross that was turned past Begovic by Wilkinson after Lambert's knock-down. Stoke improved after the break, but they should have been put out of the game, only for Do Prado to miss with the goal at his mercy. It was to be Saints' last real chance. Upson pulled one back as the ball bounced around the Saints box, with Stoke then aggrieved as Mark Clattenburg waved away appeals for a penalty when Fonte looked to have handled as Jones jumped for a header. The hosts' sense of injustice deepened when Nzonzi saw red, but Cork was arguably lucky to escape injury from the Frenchman's lunge. Even though they were a man down, City continued to press, with boss Tony Pulis deciding that four of his 10 men should be strikers. Jerome and Peter Crouch joined the action and after more scrambling in the Saints' box and the appeal against Yoshida, Stoke were finally rewarded for their spirit and persistence. Jerome pounced on Crouch's knock-down to fire high past Davis to complete a breathless afternoon at the Britannia.  Stoke manager Tony Pulis: "I thought we were awful in the first half. That's as bad as we've been. We were poor defensively and gave poor goals away, and we looked off the pace. We were slapping ourselves on the back after the Liverpool game. "But we ended up playing with a lot of commitment and desire and we think, even with 10 men, we should have won the match. It was a fantastic game for the supporters, but not for the manager."  Southampton boss Nigel Adkins: "Stoke have only conceded four at home all season, so for us to have scored three is outstanding for us. We weathered a storm and it took a wonder-strike for Stoke to get a point. We are always positive and we can always score goals. "We have matured all season and it's excellent to win a point at Stoke. We have a team that are showing a great character and a great desire to do well in this division."

24.04.2013 23:34:07 Tottenham won their sixth league game out of eight as they came from a goal down to beat Sunderland and move up to third in the Premier League. Gareth Bale headed wide and Emmanuel Adebayor's two-yard shot hit the bar, before John O'Shea side-footed in from close range for the Black Cats. Sunderland's Carlos Cuellar headed into his own net for Tottenham's leveller. Spurs winger Aaron Lennon sealed the comeback when he burst through on goal and coolly slotted home. Jermain Defoe and Adebayor should have given the scoreline a more emphatic look but the Spurs strikers were denied by keeper Simon Mignolet. Spurs winger Gareth Bale was again booked for diving and, although there did appear to be contact when he was challenged by Craig Gardner, he will miss his side's next game following a fifth yellow card of the campaign. The Welshman later insisted he had been unfairly singled out.  Sunderland beat Manchester City on Boxing Day but, despite taking the lead, could not cause another upset. Both teams went into the match in good form and the early stages involved them battling for some sort of superiority. However, the defences of each club were proving disciplined until a mistake by Black Cats midfielder James McClean after 25 minutes sparked a spell of Spurs pressure. McClean lost possession on the halfway line and Lennon slid a pass to release Adebayor, whose shot was saved with his foot by the on-rushing Mignolet. Almost immediately, right-winger Lennon skipped past a defender and sent in an inviting cross which an unmarked Bale steered wide from 10 yards. Soon after, Cuellar mistimed a clearance from a Defoe shot and, even though Adebayor beat Mignolet, his poked shot came back off the crossbar. The visitors failed to capitalise and were punished when they failed to deal with a set-piece. A Sebastian Larsson free-kick to the near post fell for Black Cats striker Steven Fletcher and, after his shot was well saved by keeper Hugo Lloris, the loose ball was slotted in by O'Shea. But Tottenham have an impressive away record this season and racked up a sixth win on the road with a second-half fightback. The visitors were gifted an equaliser when Cuellar headed Kyle Walker's near-post corner into his own goal and quickly conceded a second. A Lennon pass came back off Sunderland defender Matthew Kilgallon to the Spurs winger, who flicked the ball past O'Shea before producing a smart finish. The closest the home side came to a leveller was when Spurs keeper Lloris parried an Adam Johnson strike but it was the visitors who looked the more likely to score. Defoe chose to control and shoot from a Bale cross rather than go for a first-time shot, allowing Mignolet to scamper across and block his strike. Mignolet also came out of his goal to save an Adebayor shot late on as Spurs advanced their chances of a top-four spot.  Tottenham manager Andre Villas-Boas: "It was extremely good. Apart from the Everton fixture we have had an excellent December and to finish the year with a win like this is very good for us. I am very happy for the team. We have played a tremendous amount of games in December and it's good to get this result. "Sunderland are difficult, but to be fair we dominated most of the game. Sunderland had a go but we had the most amount of possession and the most amount of shots. In the end we got the win that we wanted."

24.04.2013 23:34:08 Manchester United moved to within seven points of securing a 20th league title with a routine win that pushed Stoke further towards the relegation zone. Robin van Persie made sure of the points with a second-half penalty that ended a run of 10 games without a goal.  That came after Michael Carrick had given United the perfect start, prodding home from a scrappy corner. The result leaves Stoke only three points above the bottom three, having won two of the last 17 league matches. This was a performance and victory typical of United's season, one that owed more to perspiration than inspiration. With it, Sir Alex Ferguson's side once again open up a 15-point gap at the top of the Premier League. Stoke, however, are falling down the division. One victory in their past 14 matches, one clean sheet in 15 league games, one point from seven matches - the statistics read like relegation form for Tony Pulis's men. And while a defeat by United may not decide their fate, crucial matches against Queens Park Rangers, Norwich and Sunderland in the weeks ahead, almost certainly will. Ferguson took nothing for granted, however. Consecutive defeats by Manchester City and Chelsea had hurt, but from the moment Carrick put United ahead there was never a chance of the champions elect losing a third successive match for the first time since May 2001. United's attacking line-up bristled with attacking menace - Shinji Kagawa provided the vision, Wayne Rooney the craft from deep and Van Persie the quick feet and eye for goal. Yet, when the opening goal did come, it was from an altogether more straightforward source, as Carrick toe-poked a low shot into the bottom corner after Van Persie's right-wing corner had been helped on by Phil Jones. It was United's 100th goal of the season and it seemed the 101st would follow soon after, as Rooney stung Asmir Begovic's palms with a rasping drive and then fizzed a free-kick just wide of the goalkeeper's right-hand post as half-time approached. But Stoke tackled, battled, denied space - Robert Huth heading a free-kick a yard wide and Kenwyne Jones making a nuisance of himself. The work-rate was admirable too, City players often doubling up on United's main threats like Kagawa, while Van Persie found he had unwelcome, unstinting company. Jonathan Walters scooped his shot over early in the second half, United goalkeeper David de Gea held a drilled effort from Charlie Adam before Jones rifled another effort over, but United weathered the storm. Van Persie found space to collect Hernandez's clever pass, only to steer his shot into the side-netting from a tight angle. If that was a warning shot, the decisive strike came soon after. Once again Van Persie found space, he bedazzled Andy Wilkinson by cutting in, feinting and twitching his way into the box, where he was brought down by the Stoke defender for a clear penalty. The wind blew the ball off the spot as Van Persie stepped up to end his 751-minute goal drought, but the Dutchman would not be denied, tucking his shot low beyond Begovic's left hand and into the corner of the net. He ran to Ferguson on the touchline, where the pair embraced knowing the league title is almost United's.  Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson:  "We are a game closer - the important thing is not to take our eye off the ball. Coming here is always a difficult game, with the wind blowing the ball all over the place. But the players stood up to that, they persevered and it was an important victory.  Robin [Van Persie] showed fantastic composure and concentration and he hit the perfect penalty - it was a great celebration. I thought Wayne Rooney looked very confident, he needs a little boost in his confidence. He is like any other player that doesn't hit the heights that people expect, or that he sets for himself, he needs a little confidence boost."  Stoke manager Tony Pulis:  "We shot ourselves in the foot. We conceded from a set piece early on, that just settled United and that took the steam out of us. For the second goal, the penalty, if Andy [Wilkinson] stays on his feet you've always got a chance at 1-0. Two poor goals have just killed the game for us. "

24.04.2013 23:34:08 Stoke City extended their unbeaten Premier League run to nine games with an impressive Boxing Day victory over Liverpool. The Reds have never won in the league at the Britannia Stadium - and manager Brendan Rodgers fared no better than his predecessors despite seeing his side take an early lead. Steven Gerrard put the visitors ahead with a penalty after Ryan Shawcross fouled Luis Suarez but Jon Walters and Kenwyne Jones led a stunning response with two quick goals to put Stoke in front. Walters scored a spectacular third just after half-time as Stoke did not simply overpower Liverpool but also showed more quality in crucial areas. Stoke's victory moves them up to eighth place in the table and also means they have gone 16 games unbeaten at their hostile home fortress. And it was easy to see why as they showed tremendous character and heart to sweep aside their early setback and run out thoroughly deserved winners. Liverpool were just too lightweight and ineffective in too many areas, with the battling Suarez a glowing exception. Rodgers will be desperate for reinforcements such as Daniel Sturridge and Thomas Ince to arrive in January to flesh out a squad that currently lacks the quality required. Stoke's fans had already marked out Suarez as the villain of the piece even before he tumbled as Shawcross hauled him down from behind in the second minute. Amid a tumultuous, angry response from the home support Gerrard remained calm to convert the penalty - Liverpool's first spot-kick in 31 games. If Liverpool thought this early strike would dent Stoke's self-belief they were sadly mistaken and the hosts were level inside three minutes, Walters beating Pepe Reina with a powerful finish after Martin Skrtel slipped as he tried to deal with a long ball. The game was turned on its head inside 12 minutes as Liverpool failed to deal with Stoke's trademark aerial power. Jones beat Daniel Agger to Glenn Whelan's corner at the near post to head in. Stoke were pressurising Liverpool in all parts of the pitch and it took a magnificent Reina save to stop Matthew Etherington's rising drive, and at the other end Gerrard was narrowly off target after good work by Stewart Downing, with Suarez also testing Asmir Begovic. Rodgers replaced Suso, who looked out of his depth, with Raheem Sterling at the start of the second half, only to see Stoke extend their lead within four minutes of the restart. Suarez had just failed with an opportunist attempt when Walters showed great technique to master Jones's flick from Andy Wilkinson's long throw, control with his chest and volley high past Reina. Liverpool's main threat throughout was Suarez, the Uruguayan tirelessly chasing every lost cause. He became even less popular with the Stoke fans after a high challenge on Begovic that brought a yellow card from referee Howard Webb. But for the remainder of the game Stoke contained what little Liverpool threat there was to emphasise their steady progress this season.

24.04.2013 23:34:08 Tottenham's Gareth Bale hit a second-half hat-trick as Aston Villa suffered a second successive heavy defeat. Villa, who on Sunday were beaten 8-0 at Chelsea in their worst ever Premier League loss, had little possession but somehow kept Spurs out up to half-time. But Kyle Naughton found Jermain Defoe to stroke in the opener from 10 yards. Bale ghosted through on the break for the second, then drilled home an Aaron Lennon pass, and completed his treble after Gylfi Sigurdsson's cut-back. After such a capitulation at Stamford Bridge last weekend there was great interest in how Villa's inexperienced young team, who had fashioned a 3-1 victory at Liverpool the week before, would cope with Tottenham's array of attacking talent. Having been frustrated by a stalemate with Stoke last week, Spurs may have feared losing further ground in the quest for Champions League qualification, but their slick passing eventually clicked into gear as they moved back into the top four on goal difference with their biggest league win under Andre Villas-Boas. Villa manager Paul Lambert made three changes from the team chastened at Chelsea, although the three central defenders from that rout were retained. From the outset the home side sat back, their two wing backs rarely venturing forward and often forming a blanket of five camped in formation around their penalty area. Stroking the ball around nonchalantly as if in a practice game, Spurs forced 15 corners by half-time, only five short of the record for an entire Premier League match, set by Portsmouth against Fulham in 2006. Despite their dominance, however, the closest Spurs came to breaking the deadlock in the opening period was from two long range Bale drives, smartly kept out by the stoic Brad Guzan. The American also rushed out of his goal to block Defoe's shot on the one occasion the diminutive poacher got in behind the Villa defence. The home side introduced Marc Albrighton at the break and hinted at greater ambition, but their decision to revert to a flat back four proved more to Tottenham's liking. Naughton found space 30 yards out and slid a perfect first-time through ball to Defoe, who placed his shot with the outside of the boot between Guzan's legs for his 10th league goal of the season. At the other end Christian Benteke had an excellent opportunity to fashion an equaliser but with two players well-placed in the box he picked out a Spurs defender and the trademark Tottenham counter-attack that followed effectively killed off the contest. Bale demonstrated both pace and poise, rounding Guzan and flicking into the net with his left foot from eight yards. As Villa wilted again, Bale provided more ruthless finishing, finding the bottom corner after neat interplay from substitute Scott Parker, Kyle Walker and Lennon. When Walker played an inviting pass for Sigurdsson on the right, Bale was again in the right place for the cross, and the 23-year-old Welshman lashed the ball emphatically past Guzan to record his first hat-trick in the top flight as Villa equalled an ignominious Premier League record of conceding 12 goals in two matches.  Aston Villa boss Paul Lambert:  "I'm not surprised by anything in football. "Things can happen. You know it can happen, especially when you are playing one of the top sides."  Tottenham manager Andre Villas-Boas:  "It was very good from start to finish. We fully deserved it. "It didn't happen for us in the first half but we kept our concentration and came on very strong in the second half. "If one team was going to win it, it was us and overall it was a very good performance."

24.04.2013 23:34:08 Everton stretched their unbeaten run to seven Premier League games as goals from Leon Osman and Phil Jagielka gave them victory over Wigan. Osman opened the scoring in the 52nd minute when his shot deflected off the arm of Gary Caldwell and into the net. Everton captain Phil Neville then marked his 500th Premier League appearance by providing the assist for Jagielka to head in Everton's second. Arouna Kone's scrappy finish gave Wigan hope, but Everton held on for the win. David Moyes's side are fifth, two points behind third-placed Chelsea, who they host on Sunday. Wigan, meanwhile, remain 18th, one point adrift of safety. The two sides went into the Goodison Park encounter in starkly contrasting form, with Everton having lost just once in the Premier League since early September, while Wigan have managed only one win in their last six games. The home side were on the attack straight from the kick-off as Darron Gibson found Nikica Jelavic, who in turn teed up Victor Anichebe on the edge of the area, but the striker lashed his shot high over the bar. That early effort proved something of a false dawn, however, with chances rare over the course of the next 20 minutes. Anichebe headed well wide of Ali Al-Habsi's goal for the home side, before Shaun Maloney's 25-yard free-kick was comfortably saved by Everton keeper Tim Howard. Wigan were looking dangerous on the break but wasteful in the final third and the best chances before half-time fell Everton's way. The Wigan defence failed to clear their lines in the 38th minute and the lively Anichebe almost capitalised, but his shot was deflected behind. A succession of corners then followed as Wigan players packed out the penalty area before cries of handball rang out from the home end as Maloney controlled the ball with his chest before clearing, but referee Lee Mason waved play on. The woodwork denied Thomas Hitzlsperger what would have been a stunning opener for Everton just two minutes into the second half. The former Aston Villa midfielder first knocked the ball through the legs of James McCarthy before launching a powerful effort from over 35 yards that, much to the relief of Al-Habsi, smashed against the top of the crossbar. A massive slice of fortune gave Everton the lead in the 52nd minute. Osman tried his luck from just outside the area and his shot, which looked to be heading wide, took a big deflection off the arm of Caldwell and looped into the back of the net with Al-Habsi stranded. Wigan felt they should have had a penalty just before the hour when Maloney tumbled under a challenge inside the area, but Mason waved away the protests, and Everton compounded Wigan's misery by adding a second goal 13 minutes from time. Neville delivered a pinpoint cross into the area and Jagielka rose highest to power a header beyond Al-Habsi. Wigan were not giving up on the chance of snatching a much-needed point, however, and the deficit was halved eight minutes from time. A shot from substitute Franco Di Santo looped up into the air off an Everton player and Kone got between two defenders to bundle the ball home. Sensing the possibility of an equaliser, the visitors pushed on after that and Everton had to withstand some late pressure to ensure they took the three points.  Everton manager David Moyes: "It was a hard fought win. I like the way Wigan play, they have a lot of the ball and when you have your chances you have to make the most of them and fortunately we did that. "We have played well this season but I knew this would be tough. There will be a lot of teams who have problems against Wigan. "I was happy when we got the first. I never really felt that secure and we gave a goal away which made it a bit rocky towards the end, but we got the three points."  Wigan manager Roberto Martinez: "I felt the performance deserved a positive result. Everton are going to show a competitive edge and you just have to match that, I felt we did that. "It was a stonewall penalty [when Shaun Maloney fell under a challenge inside the area] and that was a key moment. "That really affected us but we need to make sure we get even stronger on Saturday and get the three points."

24.04.2013 23:34:08 Rickie Lambert's late spot-kick secured a deserved point for Southampton against Fulham at Craven Cottage. The home side took the lead early in the first half through striker Dimitar Berbatov, who hooked home after Kelvin Davis could only parry a cross. It was all Southampton from then on, though, with Jason Puncheon and Lambert both close to equalising. But they were not to be denied, and Lambert emphatically converted his penalty after Chris Baird's handball. Brede Hangeland could have snatched all three points for the hosts with a header that drifted agonisingly wide in injury time, but that would have been harsh on the Saints. With only one victory from their last 11 games, Fulham were markedly better than they were last time out, when Martin Jol's side were hammered 4-0 by Liverpool. Steve Sidwell produced a resolute display in the middle of the park, tenacious in the tackle - something badly absent against the Reds - and Berbatov showed his class with his catalogue of touches, tricks and flicks. After shipping 24 goals in their opening eight league matches this season, Nigel Adkins has shored up the Saints defence considerably. The last five games have seen them concede only four goals, and this has coincided with them inching away from the relegation zone. Missing the drive of skipper Adam Lallana in midfield, big-money summer signing Gaston Ramirez was unable to find any real cohesion with the lone front-man Lambert. Fulham started much the brighter, with Sidwell flashing a shot narrowly wide, before they took the lead when goalkeeper Davis failed to deal with Sascha Riether's cross and Berbatov bundled home his sixth league goal of the season. Saints responded well though, and their confidence was boosted when Jack Cork forced a neat save from goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer with a rasping drive. Puncheon fizzed a low effort just wide and former Fulham man Steven Davis headed off target, as the visitors foraged for an equaliser. The best opening fell to Lambert in the second half. The Englishman swung a left foot at Jose Fonte's flick-on, but saw his volley fly agonisingly over the crossbar. And the pressure finally told as Baird deliberately handled in the box and Lambert smashed in the resulting spot-kick. Sidwell came close in the dying minutes, as did Hangeland, but the Saints went home with a worthy draw.  Fulham manager Martin Jol:  "I am like a thunderstorm, I am very angry. Sometimes with myself and sometimes you can do something about it. "Against Liverpool, I was angry because we didn't have the weapons to play with and that's even more frustrating. "Today I thought if we played in the way we could play, we could make a difficult for them. "We could have scored again as we had a couple of chances, but it is not enough. You will never hear me say it was enough to earn three points today because it wasn't."  Southampton manager Nigel Adkins:  "Any point picked up in the Premier League is an important one especially after going behind and we put the ball in good areas. "We tried to get in good areas and go home with something. If you look at the second half I think we've had a good amount of possession, a few opportunities. "We have good character in the team and good resolve, playing football in the right manner. "We came with the mind-set of getting three points today and Kelvin Davis was very quiet in the second half and we looked like the team who would get anything.

24.04.2013 23:34:08 Manchester United extended their Premier League lead to seven points with a thrilling win over Newcastle. James Perch pounced from close range to give the Magpies an early lead before Jonny Evans equalised in similar style then turned a cross into his own net. Patrice Evra levelled matters with a low drive before Papiss Cisse's superb shot made it 3-2 to the Magpies. Robin van Persie equalised with a drive before Javier Hernandez slid in to convert a cross in the final minute. It was a remarkable finish to an extraordinary match which saw the home side come from behind on three occasions. The result will be a bitter blow for Magpies manager Alan Pardew, although he will have been buoyed by the performance of his players, who came agonisingly close to defeating their opponents at Old Trafford for the first time since 1972. All the ingredients were there for a potentially eventful match - Boxing Day and a rain-sodden pitch. And with Manchester United fielding a side without ill and injured attacking trio Wayne Rooney, Danny Welbeck and winger Ashley Young, the visitors must have sensed the potential for an upset. For the hardened travelling fans, some in traditional fancy dress, they were presented a glimmer of hope in the fourth minute when utility player Perch scored his first league goal after keeper David de Gea weakly parried Demba Ba's angled shot. Newcastle settled into their rhythm while the league leaders repeatedly gave the ball away. They also looked short of ideas from open play, so when the equaliser came it was no surprise it was from a set-piece. Van Persie delivered a free-kick from the right which was flicked on by Ryan Giggs to Hernandez, whose shot was saved but then turned in by Evans. That was the centre-back's fourth of the season and he added a 'fifth' moments later, at the other end. This time Danny Simpson crossed low into the Manchester United area and Evans turned in at the near post. The goal was initially disallowed after Cisse was flagged in an offside position, but the decision was overturned by referee Mike Dean following consultation with his linesman. It left Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson incensed and he appeared to continue his protests seconds before the restart. His mood became more positive when Evra drilled in an angled shot from 20 yards that Tim Krul got a hand to but could not stop from creeping in. The men in red now looked the more confident of the two, but 10 minutes later the match swung back in favour of Newcastle when Cisse smashed a brilliant first-time shot past De Gea from substitute Gabriel Obertan's cross. But, once again, the Magpies' joy was short-lived when United broke soon after the restart and Van Persie scored at the second attempt after Krul had saved his initial effort. It was Van Persie's sixth goal against Newcastle in eight league matches. Sir Alex Ferguson's men are not ones to settle for a point and, after having hit the post with a header moments earlier, Hernandez timed his run to perfection to guide home Michael Carrick's inch-perfect cross.

24.04.2013 23:34:08 Juan Mata's superb strike moved Chelsea to within four points of second-placed Manchester City and consigned Norwich to a second successive defeat. Mata lit up a cagey game with a 25-yard shot before the break that just beat Mark Bunn and flew in off the post. Norwich played with plenty of bite and spirit but did not force Blues keeper Petr Cech into a noteworthy save. Sebastien Bassong came closest for the hosts with a downward header that bounced over the bar late on. Apart from that injury-time scare Chelsea were untroubled. And although they never looked likely to get anywhere near reaching the heights of the stunning 8-0 win over Aston Villa, interim manager Rafael Benitez will have been thrilled with a thoroughly professional display. Benitez had opted for the more defensive-minded John Mikel Obi ahead of Frank Lampard in midfield and the same fluency and slick passing which had blown away Villa was in short supply. The first 20 minutes were devoid of quality, chances and indeed incident. Norwich were comfortable in defence, even though they offered little going forward as they looked to bounce back from the 2-1 defeat by West Brom which had ended their 10-game unbeaten run. But Victor Moses, Mata and Oscar began to see plenty of the ball in the second half of the first period. David Luiz's willingness to run forward from midfield began to stretch the home defence and he twice shot wildly wide, while Mikel went close to grabbing his first Premier League goal with a fierce rising drive that went just over. And the pressure told when Mata smashed home his 13th goal of the season with a breathtaking 20-yard left-foot strike. Oscar wriggled away from a challenge and found the Spaniard, who beat Bunn with a fierce strike that the keeper did well to get his fingertips too. The visitors almost made it 2-0 just after the interval, but Bunn did well to keep out a lunging effort from Moses following a clever near-post corner routine, while Moses also went close with a low strike following a Cesar Azpilicueta cross. Chelsea showed no signs of trying to settle for a risky 1-0 scoreline but the Canaries began to commit greater numbers to attack and play with far greater urgency. The ever-dangerous Wes Hoolahan provided their main threat but still they could not create opportunities. Fit-again captain Grant Holt dragged a shot wide from an offside position after a fine pass from Hoolahan and a couple of Hoolahan set-pieces could easily have led to goals. Their best chance came in the dying seconds, when Bassong's downward header from a corner went comfortably over the bar. Chelsea held on, but they failed to close the 11-point gap on leaders Manchester United, who beat Newcastle with a injury-time strike.   Norwich manager Chris Hughton:  "This is a side that have just put eight past Aston Villa. We are playing against Chelsea who are on the back of a really good run and if you make the game too open they can really hurt you. "If we had a little bit more quality in the final third we could have got something, but it is difficult to get it right in both areas. "We were right in it. Our goalkeeper has not had to make too many saves [to make] and the one bit of quality shown by them was from Mata. "That's why Chelsea pay the money they do for the likes of Mata. "We have been on a good run. We have lost the last two games by one goal. If the lads keep putting in the shift they have [been doing] we will get our points."  Chelsea interim manager Rafael Benitez:  "We knew that was a difficult pitch. They won against Manchester United and Arsenal. It was tough and the weather was not helping. "I was really happy with the performance of the players. The team are showing character. I am really pleased with the work-rate and the style of play. "They didn't have too many chances and we had two or three to score a second goal. "With these kind of games against teams who are strong physically, you have to be careful. "Juan is a player who can make the difference - we are really pleased with him. He is playing really well. "Even without the ball he is working hard but when we are in possession he is making the difference. I always say the same, if the team are playing well these players can make the difference."

24.04.2013 23:34:08 West Brom won in London for the first time in 11 games to condemn QPR to the bottom of the Premier League table. Chris Brunt's low 30-yard strike opened the scoring at a rain-soaked Loftus Road as Albion jumped back up to fifth. QPR keeper Robert Green palmed the ball into his own net to put Albion 2-0 up after Armand Traore's headed clearance dropped under his own bar. Djibril Cisse dinked the ball over Ben Foster to give QPR hope but the Albion keeper saved Clint Hill's late header. It was a terrific effort by the England keeper, aided by his midfielder Youssouf Mulumbu on the line, as QPR piled on the pressure in the closing minutes in an attempt to rescue a point from the game. Gareth McAuley, Jonas Olsson and Liam Ridgewell all put in timely blocks to repel wave after wave of attacks in injury time as Albion held on. The defeat was QPR's 11th of the season and returned them to the bottom of the table on goal difference after Reading picked up a point against Swansea at the Madejski Stadium.  The last time QPR and Albion met on Boxing Day was in the 1968-9 season. West Brom won 4-0 at Loftus Road on that day and Rangers went on to be relegated from the top flight. And it looked likely that Albion would repeat that scoreline on Wednesday after they opened up a 2-0 lead early in the second half. Brunt ran on to Marc Antoine-Fortune's simple pass and without breaking stride, drove a low shot beyond Green's left hand to put Albion ahead. James Morrison almost doubled the lead before half-time with a sharp flick, turn and volley but his 22-yard effort dipped over the bar. The second goal did come though, albeit in controversial fashion. Traore, in attempting to head Brunt's corner clear, succeeded only in sending the ball high into the air and towards his own goal-line. Home keeper Green, who claimed he was being impeded by Marc-Antoine Fortune, could only palm the ball into his own net and referee Chris Foy waved away QPR protests. Green was at his best though to twice deny Romelu Lukaku in one-on-one situations, advancing quickly to snuff out the danger on both occasions. However, Rangers were struggling in attack and their lack of quality in front of goal was summed up by Stephane Mbia, who headed an Adel Taarabt corner straight back to the midfielder instead of towards goal. The visitors were well in command but a defensive lapse allowed QPR a foothold in the game - Mbia threading a beautifully weighted through ball to Cisse, who lifted his shot over the advancing Foster to make it 2-1. And from that moment, the home side looked the more likely to score. Albion defenders McAuley and Olsson both blocked shots while QPR's appeals for a penalty were waved away after Mbia's header struck Ridgewell on the elbow. From the corner, Hill rose highest but his downward header was brilliantly saved by Foster as Albion held on for the win.

24.04.2013 23:34:08 Reading lifted themselves off the foot of the Premier League table with a hard-earned draw against Swansea City at the Madejski Stadium. The Royals did have the ball in the back of the net but substitute Adam Le Fondre's 74th-minute effort was ruled out for handball. Swansea needed a goal-line clearance by Chico Flores to secure a point. Swans striker Michu, the league's leading scorer with 13 goals, limped off late in the game. Reading went into the game bottom of the table after seven straight defeats. And they were on the back foot for the first hour until Le Fondre's introduction. The striker energised the home team and looked to have scored a vital header. But the referee judged he had deliberately punched the ball into the net and booked him. Swansea pushed Michu back into the Swansea midfield to accommodate Luke Moore's first start of the season. Danny Guthrie was in the thick of the action early on, going down in the Swansea box after Flores was dispossessed by Pavel Pogrebnyak, but referee Mike Jones waved away the penalty appeals. Reading's first attempt on goal came in the 17th minute when Jimmy Kebe sliced a left-foot volley well wide. They offered little else in attack with lone striker Pogrebnyak looking isolated. Swansea should have taken the lead on the half hour when Reading defender Chris Gunter chested the ball weakly towards his goalkeeper, but Michu lifted the ball over the bar from six yards. The Royals gained in confidence after that, but never really threatened before the break. The introduction of Hal Robson-Kanu and Le Fondre gave the Royals fresh impetus midway through the second half, and the latter was heavily involved as Michel Vorm was tested in the Swansea goal. But it was the Dutch goalkeeper's opposite number Adam Federici who pulled off the stops of the game, saving brilliantly from Nathan Dyer's diving header and then holding on to a fierce shot by Ki Sung-Yeung. There was real concern for Swansea when Michu limped off after an innocent-looking off-the-ball collision, but after the game manager Michael Laudrup said the injury wasn't serious. Then Flores came to the Swans' rescue as he headed a goal-bound Le Fondre volley off the line. QPR's defeat by West Brom means Reading move to 19th in the table but still six points behind 17th-placed Southampton.

24.04.2013 23:34:08 Adam Johnson scored against his former club as Sunderland shocked Manchester City with a hard-fought victory. City had the better of the first half as Vincent Kompany hit the bar and Simon Mignolet made good saves from Yaya Toure and David Silva. Sunderland took the lead when Johnson cut in from the right and his 25-yard shot beat Joe Hart at his near post. Sergio Aguero was denied late on as City fell seven points behind Manchester United in the title race. The Black Cats dealt admirably with everything the champions threw at them in the final 10 minutes, and their margin of victory could have been greater had they shown more composure when catching City on the counter-attack. It was a disastrous result for the visitors, who slipped further behind title rivals United as a result of the Reds coming from behind three times before eventually beating Newcastle 4-3 at Old Trafford.  City will rue a number of missed chances in the first half, while their lack of width was exposed in the second as they struggled to break down the organised and determined Black Cats. It is the third time in as many seasons that this fixture has ended in a 1-0 victory for the hosts, who have now won three of their last four matches to move seven points clear of the relegation zone. Such worries will not linger for too long, on the evidence of this resolute performance. The visitors started strongly, with Kompany's header hitting the bar from a corner and Yaya Toure's follow-up shot being saved by Mignolet. The Belgium keeper kept his side in the game with another superb save from Silva after the Spaniard had been teed up from six yards by Aguero. The skill and movement of City's front three - Aguero, Silva and Carlos Tevez - looked like overwhelming the hosts, but Sunderland became much more compact after the half-hour. Steven Fletcher brought a good save out of Hart before half-time as Sunderland began to show belief. The spirit which became the foundation of their performance was epitomised when winger James McClean tracked back and denied Tevez with a superbly-timed tackle. City looked increasingly short of ideas in the second half, and it was no surprise when Johnson gave Sunderland the lead with a left-footed shot which was deflected in by Hart. City complained the goal should not have been allowed to stand after Pablo Zabaleta appeared to be fouled by Craig Gardner in the build-up, but their protests were waved away. Sunderland grew in stature and, led by on-loan Spurs full-back Danny Rose's superb defensive play, they repelled almost everything City threw at them. Aguero had a shot turned wide by Mignolet and substitute Edin Dzeko fired straight at the keeper. At the other end, City were hanging on as Stephane Sessegnon broke clear through the middle and was denied by Hart before Fraizer Campbell shot straight at the England keeper from only six yards. City threw on defender Joleon Lescott as an emergency striker, but it only served to highlight their desperation and lack of ideas as they slipped to their first away defeat of the season.

24.04.2013 23:34:08 Chelsea turned on the style to completely destroy in-form Aston Villa and move back up to third place in the Premier League. Fernando Torres continued his resurgence under Blues manager Rafael Benitez with a towering third-minute header to set the Blues on their way. And a stunning David Luiz free-kick and Branislav Ivanovic header as good as wrapped up victory before the interval. Frank Lampard marked his 500th Premier League start by crashing home a fourth on the hour and two strikes from substitute Ramires, an Oscar penalty and a fine individual effort from Eden Hazard rounded off the scoring. As well as providing more evidence of Chelsea's growing momentum under Benitez, the thrashing revised the Premier League record books. The result marked the first time seven players from one team have scored in a match and matched Chelsea's record 8-0 win over Wigan from May 2010.  An unchanged Villa actually went into the game buoyed by their fine recent form and stunning win over Liverpool last Saturday. But they fell behind within two minutes and by the time Ivanovic struck 11 minutes before the break, the visitors appeared to be completely deflated and they were ripped apart at will in the second half. A majestic performance from Lampard, and his midfield partner Luiz, laid the platform for a dominant display that could have easily seen them reach double figures. By the end Villa looked a shadow of the side who have been playing with such spirit, energy and passion and who headed to Stamford Bridge unbeaten in six and with a Capital One Cup semi-final date against Bradford looming. In contrast Benitez's Blues played with the sort of fluency and class that even the manager's staunchest critic will find hard to resist as they bettered Liverpool's 6-0 win over Derby in September 2007 to deliver the Spaniard's best league win in English football. The hosts started where they left off against Leeds in midweek, Torres opening the scoring with his seventh goal in six games when he found the top corner with a superb 15-yard header from a teasing Ivanovic cross. Villa held their own for 20 minutes but Luiz crashed home a wondrous, dipping 25-yard free-kick to double the lead. And after Ivanovic reacted brilliantly to head in after a fine turn and shot from fellow centre-back Gary Cahill, Villa simply capitulated. England midfielder Lampard, so influential in Chelsea's midweek Capital One cup battering of Leeds, gave a typically authoritative display which makes a mockery of any suggestion that he would not be offered a new contract at Stamford Bridge. He smashed in the fourth from 25 yards on the hour and the floodgates truly opened as Chelsea scored four goals in the final 15 minutes. Substitute Ramires slotted number five after a fine pass from fellow substitute Lucas Piazon. Another sub, Oscar, blasted number six into the roof of the net after he was felled by Chris Herd. Number seven duly arrived when Hazard danced through, exchanged passes with Piazon, and arrowed a shot into the corner of the net. Piazon saw a late penalty brilliantly saved after being fouled by Ciaran Clark, but the eighth goal did arrive when Ramires side-footed in after a break from Oscar.

24.04.2013 23:34:08 Paolo Di Canio masterminded Sunderland's first victory at St James' Park in 13 years to give their Premier League survival hopes a massive boost while dragging Newcastle into the relegation scrap. In only the Italian's second game in charge, his team delivered a devastating blow to their arch rivals as Stephane Sessegnon's first-half goal was followed up by strikes by Adam Johnson and David Vaughan late in the second period. The manner of the victory will give fresh hope to the Black Cats, who moved three points clear of the relegation zone with five games to go and to within two points of Alan Pardew's side. And it also looked to have justified the surprise dismissal of former boss Martin O'Neill as Di Canio's side reversed their slump of nine games without a win in some style. If the Italian's appointment was intended to garner a response from the team, then it was met in stunning fashion in a victory which Sunderland richly deserved. The charismatic, and sometime maligned, manager celebrated all three goals with typical verve and went onto the pitch after the final whistle to revel in an historic performance from his side, which will go a long way to establishing his status as a saviour should the club stay up. Newcastle fans were warned about their behaviour prior to the game as there was speculation they could taunt Di Canio with fascist salutes given his political past.  But thankfully, the game was remembered for the performance on the pitch in a highly charged atmosphere as Sunderland withstood first-half pressure to take control. Before Sunderland took the lead, they had two penalty claims with the first - when Steven Taylor pulled Danny Graham's shirt - looking like the visitors had a case. The noise during the opening exchanges was immense, but the majority of St James' Park was stunned into silence when Sessegnon picked up Jonas Gutierrez's loose ball, drove at the Newcastle defence and squeezed a shot past Tim Krul. Di Canio sprinted down the touchline and leapt into the air in delight, but he soon regained his composure to deliver careful instructions to his troops. The Newcastle response came almost immediately with Simon Mignolet twice producing good stops to deny Papiss Cisse and it helped to restore a measure of control for Sunderland. Indeed, the visitors could have gone further ahead before the break when Carlos Cuellar climbed highest to head Sebastian Larsson's corner towards goal, but Krul made an assured save. Newcastle's desperation to get an equaliser then boiled over on a couple of occasions as Cisse and Steven Taylor went into the book, with Danny Rose also cautioned for a stern challenge on Mathieu Debuchy. Despite some scares, Sunderland were marshalling Cisse quite well which was enough for Pardew to bring on Shola Ameobi up front and later introduce Hatem Ben Arfa in an attempt to yield an equaliser. Having tested Mignolet again after the hour mark, Cisse then had a goal wrongly ruled out for offside, as he was played on by Cuellar following a free-kick, and it proved a turning point. Newcastle had to replace the injured goalkeeper Krul with Rob Elliot but the new addition could do nothing as Johnson countered and then struck a delightful curler into the top corner. That put Sunderland fans and the visitors' bench in wonderland, but more delight was to come when again they broke forward, and substitute Vaughan stayed onside to drive another stunner into the top corner with eight minutes left. Di Canio's name rang around St James' Park, a prospect that few would have anticipated at the start of the game.

24.04.2013 23:34:08 Manchester United will lead the Premier League by four points going into Christmas after a frustrating draw at resolute Swansea. Patrice Evra's header from a Robin van Persie corner put United in front. Swansea hit back with Michu tapping in after Jonathan De Guzman's shot had been blocked by keeper David De Gea. United struck the woodwork twice after the break, while Van Persie reacted angrily when Ashley Williams' clearance hit him on the back of the head. Williams lashed the ball away after 74 minutes and it struck a grounded Van Persie, who angrily squared up to the defender, with both players being booked. Van Persie had gone close to grabbing a winner for his side when he looped a shot on to the crossbar and team-mate Michael Carrick also had a header tipped against the woodwork. United piled on the pressure late on and Van Persie also had a shot blocked by Williams before Ashley Young's follow-up effort struck Ben Davies in the goalmouth. Despite the second-half rally, United were held to a first league draw of the season by a stubborn Swansea. The Old Trafford side had led the top flight by six points heading into the weekend but their advantage has been cut by two, with second-placed Manchester City beating Reading on Saturday.  United have kept only four clean sheets this season and have conceded 25 goals and, while their attacking exploits have regularly rescued them, it was not to be this time around. It had started in promising fashion for the Red Devils as they forced Swansea keeper Michel Vorm, who was back after 10 games out with a groin injury, into two smart saves. Vorm fended away a long range strike by Wayne Rooney before palming a Young shot wide after Carrick's defence-splitting pass. From the resulting corner, Evra glanced in a header off the post, despite Leon Britton standing next to the upright. However, United's defensive frailties were exposed again as Swansea equalised. Wayne Routledge slipped a clever pass through to De Guzman and, although his shot was blocked by keeper De Gea, Michu put away the loose ball for his 13th league goal of the campaign. United were aggrieved about a challenge on Van Persie by Chico at the start of the move, although the hosts still had plenty to do and the visitors' defending left a lot to be desired. Centre-back Nemanja Vidic was making his first start for Sir Alex Ferguson's after three months out with a knee injury but there was still an air of vulnerability about United at the back. The goal gave Swansea renewed vigour and De Guzman had an acute-angled shot saved by De Gea. An entertaining game was producing chances at both ends and a lacklustre Rooney might have hoped to have done better when he fired straight at Vorm from Evra's cut back. Swansea responded with Kemy Agustien having a well-struck long range shot saved before Routledge's low, angled strike was palmed wide. United smothered Swansea in the final quarter of the match and, even though Van Persie, Carrick and Young went close, the hosts stood firm to avoid a third league loss on the trot.

24.04.2013 23:34:08 Liverpool's Stewart Downing put in an impressive display as the Reds overwhelmed a tame Fulham to move up to eighth in the Premier League. Martin Skrtel controlled a Steven Gerrard corner and powered in a shot to put the home side in front. Downing's piercing ball then set up Gerrard to drive in Liverpool's second. Winger Downing cut inside and rifled in a shot for his first Premier League goal for the Reds, before Luis Suarez side-footed in to seal an emphatic win.  Downing claims he has been told he can leave Liverpool, but his lively display against the Cottagers suggests he wants to stay and fight for his place. The 28-year-old helped raise Liverpool's hopes of reasserting a challenge for a top-four place as the Anfield club moved five points off the Champions League places. Fulham had problems in midfield with Steve Sidwell, Bryan Ruiz and Mahamadou Diarra missing, but manager Martin Jol will be concerned at the meek surrender of a side which has one win in 10 top-flight outings. Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers said his team were determined to put right the wrongs of last week's 3-1 home defeat by Aston Villa and the Reds quickly showed the pace, movement and intensity to echo their manager's words on the pitch. Unmarked centre-back Daniel Agger headed a driven corner over the Fulham goal and Liverpool midfielder Jonjo Shelvey had a clever flicked effort from Downing's low cross deflected wide. Fulham had not learnt from those scares and the home side took the lead when defender Skrtel was allowed the time and space to control Gerrard's corner before thundering in a shot. The early goal only served to increase the appetite and the Reds should have added another goal only for a lunging Agger to sidefoot over from close range after a low Suarez cross. Fulham midfielder Kieran Richardson's swerving shot almost caught Pepe Reina out before he saved the effort with his legs but the visitors fell further behind after 36 minutes. The much-maligned Downing provided his first assist in 45 Premier League appearances for the Reds when he slid a precise ball through the heart of the Cottagers' defence to Gerrard, who angled a shot past keeper Mark Schwarzer. A deflected Downing cross set up Suarez for a gilt-edged chance at the far post shortly after the interval but the Uruguayan sent his six-yard shot wide. Downing was playing in a preferred right-wing berth as opposed to the left-back spot he has sometimes had to fill and took it upon himself to add Liverpool's third as he cut inside before drilling a left-footed shot past Schwarzer. Fulham were hugely outplayed and it was one-way traffic as Liverpool constantly threatened more goals. Suarez bustled his was through the Cottagers' defence only to be foiled by a smothering Schwarzer save and the striker also had a well-struck free-kick tipped around the post by the 'keeper. Reina saved a Hugo Rodallega free-kick before Suarez rounded off his side's win by converting a Jose Enrique cut-back for his 11th league goal of the season.  Fulham manager Martin Jol: "Of course you will say that Liverpool were great today, but they weren't. "I don't think that we played well. It is disappointing, the second half was a bit better, Karim Frei showed some spirit, but it was bad defending on the third goal as we backed off. "On the fourth goal from the corner kick it was almost too easy. "Our intentions were to play the ball to the front three and get Berbatov into the game and support from midfield - we didn't do it."

24.04.2013 23:34:08 Gareth Barry scored a 92nd-minute winner as Manchester City stunned Reading to close the gap on leaders Manchester United to three points. Premier League champions City looked set to be held by the bottom-placed club before Barry rose above Nicky Shorey to head in David Silva's cross. Barry and Carlos Tevez went close in a one-sided first half, while substitute Edin Dzeko had chances in the second. Reading felt they deserved a penalty for a challenge on Jay Tabb at 0-0. Tabb went down after contact from City's 18-year-old left-back Karim Rekik on his debut. The visitors also argued that Barry should have been penalised for climbing on substitute Shorey for the goal. But referee Mike Dean was unmoved on both occasions and City's win halved United's advantage at the top ahead of their trip to Swansea on Sunday, Reading, by contrast, sit at the foot of the table with seven straight defeats, their worst run since an eight-match losing streak between December 2007 and February 2008. They were relegated that season. This was City's first match at Etihad Stadium since defeat by United and they did not look entirely convincing. Joe Hart was almost embarrassed early on after Jimmy Kebe intercepted his pass, while Jobi McAnuff headed over the bar. But the expected pattern of play emerged as Sergio Aguero fed Carlos Tevez with a fine touch, only for Adam Federici to save. City had won all of the 13 previous league matches Aguero and Tevez started together, and the pair again looked sharp, Tevez crossing for Barry to head powerfully at Federici. Yaya Toure wanted a penalty for an Alex Pearce challenge following slick work by Tevez and Silva, while a Tevez shot was deflected just over and nobody was on hand meet an Aguero cross. While City continued to press after the break, Reading created the clearest chance when an unmarked Pearce headed off target from Ian Harte's corner. Manager Roberto Mancini opted to bring Dzeko on for Javi Garcia - replacing a midfielder with a striker - and it almost paid immediate dividends. Dzeko came within inches of heading home Pablo Zabaleta's cross and then nodded a Tevez corner narrowly over the bar. At the other end, Dean ignored Reading protests following Rekik's collision with Tabb, Pavel Pogrebnyak almost picked out Kebe and Pearce headed wide for a second time. But no side had scored more goals in the final 30 minutes of Premier League games this season than City - a tally that is at 21 - and the late rally arrived as Silva nodded over and Aguero hit the side-netting. It was left to Barry to secure the points with his controversial winner.

24.04.2013 23:34:08 Shola Ameobi scored his third goal of the season as Newcastle handed Harry Redknapp his first defeat as Queens Park Rangers manager. It looked like being a frustrating day for the Magpies, who had lost six of their previous seven games, as Demba Ba and Papiss Cisse missed good chances. But substitute Ameobi rifled in a shot with nine minutes remaining for his first league goal in nine months. QPR battled hard, with striker Djibril Cisse missing their best chance. Rangers, who defended stoutly and looked dangerous on the counter-attack, thought they had done enough as they looked to continue their mini-revival under new manager Redknapp. However, it was Redknapp's opposite number Alan Pardew who changed the course of the match, with two of his substitutes having a direct influence in the match-winning strike. Sylvain Marveaux replaced Cheick Tiote with 13 minutes left, and his extra quality created the opportunity for Ameobi to collect the Frenchman's pass, cut inside and find the back of the net with a classy finish. It justified Pardew's decision to replace Papiss Cisse with Ameobi - a substitution which caused some discontent from the stands, and plenty of frustration from the Senegalese striker. Papiss Cisse refused to shake his manager's hand as he angrily made his way to the dugout to watch the remainder of the match. It capped a miserable day for the number nine, as he and his strike partner Ba struggled to break down a resolute Rangers defence expertly marshalled by Ryan Nelsen. The one time the two did link up to good effect midway through an uninspiring first half ended with Cisse being denied by Fabio's well-timed tackle. Ba also fired two free-kicks into the stands as Newcastle looked short on ideas without influential midfielders Yohan Cabaye and Hatem Ben Arfa. QPR almost stunned St James' Park after the break when Adel Taarabt, who scored two goals in his side's victory over Fulham last weekend, showcased some outrageous skill to leave three defenders in his wake and slotted a pass through for Djibril Cisse. The French striker held off his marker, but his shot found the side-netting. Newcastle were struggling for inspiration, until Pardew brought on Ameobi and Gabriel Obertan with just half an hour to go. The change worked a treat, as the home side became much more of a threat in the final third - Ba turning and having a shot deflected over and then having a weak header saved by Rob Green. A goal seemed inevitable, and it was no surprise when Ameobi slotted home. There was still time for the impressive Marveaux to go close with two shots that were well saved by Green, but Newcastle had done enough. The only negative to come out of the game for the hosts was a fifth booking of the season for Tiote, which rules the midfielder out of his side's Boxing Day trip to Manchester United. Rangers will take plenty of heart from their workmanlike performance, with defeats for their relegation rivals Reading, Wigan and Southampton meaning very little has changed in the bottom four.  Newcastle boss Alan Pardew: "I know the crowd weren't particularly pleased when I took Cisse, a goalscorer, off but I just felt Shola, he's a big man and this was a big occasion and he likes big occasions. "It said QPR on the programme but really it was bigger than that, I think we all knew that and he has that calm head - he knows what is demanded here - to produce a quality goal, and it won us the game. "I wanted to get Shola on the pitch, and thank goodness I did because it was a really class finish."  QPR boss Harry Redknapp: "I thought we were going to hang on and nick a draw. I couldn't see us winning, but we just couldn't see it through. "I thought we could hang on for a good point to keep us going, but it just wasn't to be."

24.04.2013 23:34:08 Steven Fletcher's eighth Premier League goal of the season proved enough to beat Southampton and lift Sunderland four points clear of the drop zone. The Saints began well but a Rickie Lambert set-piece was as close as they got before Fletcher steered in a mishit effort from Stephane Sessegnon. The goal took the wind out of the hosts and Jose Fonte's forceful header was a rare second-half threat to Sunderland. The visitors coasted home as a comeback failed to materialise. Sunderland's rich run of form in the early days of Martin O'Neill's reign, just over a year ago, has felt far more distant for the Wearsiders this season. But this victory, combined with seven points from matches over Wigan, Reading and QPR, should reassure fans that they have enough quality to stay clear of the relegation zone. Southampton have finishing in at least 17th place as their top priority in their first season back in the top flight and have looked far more likely to obtain it recently. After one win in their opening 11 games, Southampton manager Nigel Adkins has managed to stem the flow of sloppy goals at one end without sacrificing the attractive attacking intent at the other. The hosts' confidence was obvious in the opening stages. Maya Yoshida and skipper Fonte ushered an apparently struggling Fletcher down cul-de-sacs, while Gaston Ramirez's neat touches filled the absence of regular captain Adam Lallana in attack for the hosts. But for all their pretty approach play, Southampton could not manoeuvre their way into a clear sight at goal. Ramirez's dipping long-range effort was comfortably dealt with by goalkeeper Simon Mignolet and Lambert fizzed a free-kick a foot wide, before Fletcher's predatory instincts sniffed out the opener against the run of play. The Scot, substituted at half-time in recent matches against Manchester United and Norwich, had appeared to be hampered by a back injury, but was alert to turn in Sessegnon's shanked shot after Adam Johnson had found space down the left flank. The former Wolves man has now scored with over half of his shots on target in the Premier League this season Emmanuel Mayuka, on an industrious full debut for Southampton, had his appeals for a penalty turned down soon after as referee Howard Webb ruled that Carlos Cueller's rugged challenge had taken the ball. But Southampton look deflated to find themselves behind and Craig Gardner's teasing delivery deserved a decisive touch from either Fletcher or Sessegnon as the hosts struggled to rouse themselves after the break. The introduction of Steve de Ridder  injected some life into the home side and Fonte's header was cleared by Jack Colback before Jason Puncheon almost wriggled into a dangerous position on the byeline. But it was not until the last few minutes that Southampton managed to force the Black Cats back into their own penalty area. Goalkeeper Kelvin Davis came up for a corner but the ball would not settle for Guly Do Prado in front of goal as time ran out and Sunderland clinched only their second win in 17 Premier League away games.  Southampton manager Nigel Adkins: "Today seemed to be a game that was uncharacteristically flat. We gave Sunderland something that they could hang on to and they did that very well. "We moved the ball about very well, but we did not get the breakthrough and the Sunderland goal changed the complexion of the game. "The players have put the effort in but it was not to be. We have to put this one to bed and get ready for Fulham." Adkins' added that captain Adam Lallana would not recover from a knee injury in time to play against Fulham on 26 December.  Sunderland manager Martin O'Neill: "It was a big performance from us today, and I am thrilled not only for the team but also the fans who have travelled down today. "It is a long long time since they had something to shout about. We had to make a few changes we reverted to a back four that have played in recent times and I thought they were terrific. "Steven Fletcher has scored a lot of us and all of them have been important, there have not been any third goals in three-goal wins. He has been fantastic and at times I think we are struggling to keep up with him."

24.04.2013 23:34:08 Tottenham missed the chance to go third in the Premier League as they were held to a goalless draw by stubborn Stoke at White Hart Lane. Stoke, now unbeaten in eight matches, almost went ahead after 45 seconds when Kenwyne Jones shot over from 20 yards following Kyle Walker's sloppy pass. In a game of few chances Gareth Bale headed over from six yards and Gylfi Sigurdsson's late header was saved. The 0-0 draw is the Potters' fifth of the season, the most in Europe. Tony Pulis's side have aspirations of qualifying for Europe and, on this evidence, that is an entirely realistic ambition. Their downfall this season has been their away form - one win from nine games before the trip to White Hart Lane does not compare to their excellent home record - but they are difficult opponents regardless of the venue. Indeed, they have now lost only three of their 18 league fixtures this season and possess one of the most miserly defences in Europe, a quality that was on show in north London. While Stoke are an established, well-drilled unit, Tottenham still appear a team trying to find their rhythm under boss Andre Villas-Boas, although they grew into the match after a sluggish start. Buoyed by the return of influential winger Bale to the starting XI after a hamstring injury, Spurs might have been expected to begin on the front foot, but they were almost behind following a defensive blunder from Walker. The England full-back tried a needlessly ambitious pass across the face of his own penalty area inside the first minute but succeeded only in finding Jones, who blazed over from the edge of the box. Perhaps Spurs' lethargy was to be expected, since only five of the 24 goals scored at home this season have come in the first 45 minutes of matches. True to form, they showed greater urgency in the second period. Jermain Defoe shot over from 25 yards a minute after the break before Bale failed to capitalise on his side's best opening of the first hour. After swapping flanks with Aaron Lennon, the England winger crossed from the left and Bale, arriving late at the back post, headed over from close range. Defoe's partnership with Emmanuel Adebayor remains a work in progress but there were plenty of signs to suggest it can flourish, Defoe repeatedly finding space afforded him by his fellow striker's movement. But Stoke's defence, expertly marshalled by captain Ryan Shawcross, limited Spurs to half-chances, Defoe flashing a shot wide, Mousa Dembele's drive deflecting into Asmir Begovic's arms and the keeper saving well from Sigurdsson's glancing header in the final minute. Spurs, though, could not find the breakthrough and drop to fifth in the table, as ninth-placed Stoke showed why they might be among the challengers for a European place come the end of the season.  Tottenham manager Andre Villas-Boas: "It is difficult to break them down. We tried everything from the first minute but Stoke proved why they are on a magnificent unbeaten run. "We had lots of possession and lots of shots from outside the box, but we can't be negative because we gave it a go. We tried to get the three points but we couldn't do it today."  Stoke manager Tony Pulis: "Tottenham are a very good side with outstanding individuals who can win a game in a second, but I thought we played really well in the first half and we had our chances. "We're pleased that we limited them, with most of their chances coming from outside the box. Tottenham are on a different level to us really when you look at what they've got, but if you work hard you've always got a chance."

24.04.2013 23:34:08 West Brom ended Norwich's unbeaten run with a hard-fought win, which ended six-hours of football without  a goal for the home side. Robert Snodgrass gave Norwich the lead with a free-kick but Zoltan Gera equalised before the break . Albion had the better of the second half before Romelu Lukaku headed home a Goran Popov cross for the winner. West Brom saw off a late fightback to end a strong run of form for Norwich, who had been unbeaten in 10 games. The Canaries kept the ball immaculately at times but lacked punch up front, while Albion's more direct approach eventually paid dividends. Recent results had seen the two sides heading in opposite directions in the Premier League table. West Brom's run of one point from a possible 12 pushed them down from a high point of third, while 10 games without defeat had propelled the Canaries to within reach of the European places. Romelu Lukaku, the last player to score for West Brom when he netted against Swansea more than five hours before Saturday's match kicked off, went close when his glancing header from Popov's cross flew a yard over in only the second minute. Norwich took the upper hand for a while, patiently keeping the ball, while the home side's tactics were much more straight-forward. Lukaku spurned another chance around 20 minutes, shooting straight at City goalkeeper Mark Bunn, shortly after Bradley Johnson had lashed a volley wide for Norwich. The visitors took the lead at the half's midway point. Robert Snodgrass' free kick from the right curled over the wall towards the top corner, and although Ben Foster got a hand to it he could not prevent the ball from flying in. The goal stung Albion into action, with Gareth McAuley throwing himself at a corner only to see Bunn make a save with his right foot just in front of the line, while Popov hit a fierce shot just over the bar. West Brom finally broke their goal drought two minutes before the break. Jonas Olsson's header from a Chris Brunt corner bounced up onto the bar thanks to the slightest of touches from Bunn, but Gera was alert enough to volley the rebound home from close range. Following the busy end to the first half, the second lacked urgency by comparison, with neither goalkeeper seriously troubled. Goalscorer Snodgrass nearly turned provider 10 minutes after the restart, but Michael Turner headed his cross a long way wide of Foster's right-hand post. Peter Odemwingie stepped up for a free kick from around the same spot that Snodgrass had scored from, but his low effort, drilled straight into the wall, typified a period where neither side could threaten the opposing keeper. Just eight minutes remained when Lukaku beat Javier Garrido to Popov's cross to head the ball powerfully home from eight yards out. Norwich keeper Mark Bunn went forward for a corner deep into stoppage time to no avail, and Albion held firm to earn three points for the first time since their visit to Sunderland in late November.  West Brom manager Steve Clarke:  In this league, the longer you go without a win it can start to become a problem, so we wanted to put that one away before Christmas. Going with four up front gave Norwich a different problem, we had four forwards buzzing around, stopping them from playing like they had in the first half. Boaz Myhill has been exceptional for us, he has done really well but Ben's the number one goalkeeper. He's had his injury problems, he's worked hard in rehab and I just decided today was the day to put him back in.  Norwich City manager Chris Hughton:  It was always going to be tough, with the form they have showed. I thought we gave a good account of ourselves, their opportunities were limited but I'm very disappointed with the goal we conceded at a bad time before half time. There was a challenge on Mark Bunn, but I'll have to have another look at that one. We should have reacted a little bit better once it came off the crossbar, it was a poor goal for us to concede, particularly at that time. On the balance of play I thought we played some good football but without creating the chances we would have liked.

24.04.2013 23:34:08 Everton came from behind to beat West Ham United and move back into fourth place as both sides ended with 10 men at Upton Park. Carlton Cole gave West Ham an early lead but was then shown a hotly-contested red card for a high challenge on Leighton Baines after the interval. Victor Anichebe had already headed Everton level after 64 minutes and they cashed in on West Ham's numerical disadvantage when Steven Pienaar scrambled in what proved to be the winner shortly after Cole was sent off. Everton had opportunities to increase their lead but Kevin Nolan squandered a late opportunity to equalise for West Ham as they attempted to overcome the handicap of Cole's dismissal to earn a point. Darron Gibson was also sent off in stoppage time by referee Anthony Taylor after a collision with Mark Noble that had to be met with similar punishment to Cole - leaving both managers unhappy at the final whistle. West Ham manager Sam Allardyce will feel his side suffered an injustice, but Everton counterpart David Moyes will view this as a vital three points as they continue to battle at the top end of the table. Everton were missing Marouane Fellaini, who started a three-game suspension after headbutting Stoke's Ryan Shawcross, but still started brightly. Sylvain Distin should have done better than head down and over the top from Baines's free-kick - then Everton saw a goal ruled out in contentious circumstances. The diminutive figure of Leon Osman rose to head in a corner from Baines but, much to Everton's obvious fury, the celebrations were halted by a linesman's flag. It looked like Anichebe had been penalised for impeding goalkeeper Jussi Jaaskelainen but Anichebe would counter but saying he was simply standing his ground. Everton's frustration deepened as Cole gave West Ham the lead soon after, escaping John Heitinga far too easily and shooting low past Tim Howard. The Merseysiders emerged with far more intent after the break and Nikica Jelavic should have equalised when the ball broke to him eight yards out after a penalty area scramble but the Croat could only shoot straight at Jaaskelainen. Everton's pressure was mounting, however, and they restored parity when Anichebe got a glancing touch on to Pienaar's cross to leave Jaaskelainen helpless. If Everton thought they had been harshly treated by Osman's disallowed goal, West Ham were left nursing an equal sense of injustice when Cole was sent off in the 66th minute. The striker's foot was raised in a challenge with Baines and he caught the England defender, but there was still surprise when referee Taylor produced the red card. And to make matters worse for West Ham, Everton were soon in front as Pienaar scrambled in a finish at the near post after Osman had made inroads into the penalty area. Jelavic's assured finishing took had deserted him in a poor personal performance and he could only find the sidenetting when presented with a chance to wrap up Everton's victory. Nolan was West Ham's main danger in the closing stages and twice had opportunities to equalise, once with a shot that was deflected inches wide then when he uncharacteristically off target when clean through.

24.04.2013 23:34:08 Mikel Arteta's penalty secured a third consecutive Premier League victory for Arsenal for the first time since March. Arouna Kone wasted Wigan's best chance when he broke clear in the first half and failed to hit the target. Arteta scored from the spot just before the hour after Jean Beausejour was penalised for a challenge on Theo Walcott, who again played as a striker. Wigan have lost six of their last eight games and are in the bottom three at Christmas for the third straight year. Gunners boss Arsene Wenger joked about coming through a "super crisis" after the 5-2 win at Reading on Monday. And the Frenchman will take a large measure of satisfaction with the way his team, who were unspectacular but efficient, dealt with a difficult afternoon at the DW Stadium. With festive matches against Newcastle and Southampton to come, Wenger will be confident his team can enter the new year with a tight grip on a top-four spot. Although he earned the penalty, Walcott, whose future remains uncertain, was deprived of service for much of the game and the closest he came to scoring was a second-half free-kick. But his contribution was enough to provide yet more frustration for Wigan. Wigan manager Roberto Martinez has been hampered by defensive injuries in recent weeks and the loss of a fourth centre-back in Antonio Lopez, who is out for 10 weeks with a hamstring problem, forced him to use a back four against the Gunners rather than three central defenders. Martinez will be desperate for Gary Caldwell, Ivan Ramis and Antolin Alcaraz to return to action over the festive period. Arsenal began well and after Arteta was allowed to carry the ball from halfway, he fed Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, whose drive was pushed past the post by Wigan goalkeeper Ali Al Habsi. For all of their selection issues, Wigan played with purpose and Kone should have done better when he beat Jack Wilshere and Thomas Vermaelen before hitting a tame shot straight at Wojciech Szczesny. The Ivory Coast striker threatened again when he was played through by Franco Di Santo and tore away from Per Mertesacker, but his shot squirmed wide. Wigan full-backs Ronnie Stam and Beausejour were still getting forward at every opportunity, yet Arsenal began to exploit the space behind Beausejour after the interval, with Walcott denied from close-range by Al Habsi when set up by Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. It was a policy that paid off when Walcott dropped wide and swapped passes with Santi Cazorla before going down under Beausejour's challenge. Arteta waited for Al Habsi to dive as he stroked in his third successful penalty of the season. Wigan responded with Kone cutting in from the left and forcing a save from Szczesny, while Maynor Figueroa had a drive held by the goalkeeper. David Jones thumped a shot narrowly wide from just outside the area and the hosts had a penalty appeal for a handball against Kieran Gibbs turned down as Arsenal survived a nervous finale.  Wigan boss Roberto Martinez: "That first goal was going to be crucial. The penalty was very soft. Theo was very clever. "At the other end, it was a clear penalty [for a handball against Kieran Gibbs] because the hands were not in a natural position. "We are going through a spell where the calls are not going for us, but I am proud of the players. Once all the players are back we will get the rewards."  Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger: "It was hard-fought. Wigan are a good side. We were not as good, sharp and fluent as Monday [when beating Reading]. "It was a tough game and Wigan can surprise a lot of teams. Once we were 1-0 up it was all Wigan but we were well organised. It looked like from outside [that it was a penalty for us]." Asked if Theo can play up front, he added: "I am convinced he can do that. Today he didn't get that much service but he worked hard and got us the penalty."

24.04.2013 23:34:09 Arsenal started to heal the wounds inflicted by the Capital One Cup humiliation at League Two Bradford City with an impressive win at Reading. Lukas Podolski gave Arsenal an early lead and the Gunners were four up on the hour mark after Santi Cazorla became only the third Spaniard to score a Premier League hat-trick after Fernando Torres and Jordi Gomez.  Reading, utterly outclassed, raised the prospect of the most unlikely comeback as Adam Le Fondre and Jimmy Kebe scored twice in the space of five minutes. But Theo Walcott, impressive in the central striker's role he sees as crucial to his Arsenal future, snuffed out any Reading optimism with a composed finish that sends Arsene Wenger's side up to fifth place in the table. As an exercise in recovery after the misery of Bradford, this will have done Arsenal's confidence and morale a power of good - and supports Wenger's claim that his side still have plenty to offer this season. It was a victory, however, that needs to be seen in the context of the limp opposition offered by Reading, who are now in serious danger of being cut adrift at the bottom of the Premier League, where they remain six points from safety. Royals manager Brian McDermott has overseen progress that has taken Reading a long way in a short time - but there were spells on Monday when what is required in the Premier League looked a long way beyond them. Arsenal dominated with embarrassing ease for long periods against a home side who, for the first hour at least, gave the ominous impression of a side simply passing through on their way back into the Championship. The presence of Walcott and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain gave Arsenal a pace and movement Reading simply could not handle - with plenty of others, Cazorla chief among them, willing to join in to add extra attacking options. Oxlade-Chamberlain delivered a taste of things to come in a harrowing opening half for Reading when he forced a fine save from keeper Adam Federici inside two minutes. Reading had a couple of moments of encouragement when the powerful Pavel Pogrebnyak almost stole in behind Arsenal's defence, and again when Noel Hunt glanced a header just over. But the visitors made good on their early threat after 14 minutes. Kieran Gibbs was the provider with a cross from the right, allowing Podolski to arrive in space and take a perfect first touch before firing past Federici. Podolski then shot narrowly wide before Walcott's speed took him into open space behind Reading's hopeless defence only for Federici to block with his legs. Federici was distinguishing himself amid the carnage around him and saved well from Jack Wilshere before Cazorla added an inevitable second just after the half-hour as he headed in Podolski's cross. Reading were falling apart and Cazorla added the third soon after, again taking advantage of dreadful marking to swivel and beat Federici from close range. The plight of the home side was cruelly illustrated when their own fans broke into ironic cheers to mark a short spell of possession, an act hardly designed to offer encouragement. The Royals survived the first 15 minutes of the second half before Arsenal made it four, Cazorla completing his hat-trick after Wilshere found Podolski, who unselfishly set up the Spaniard for a simple finish. As the Madejski sat back and waited for Arsenal to add more goals, Reading suddenly came to life and two quick goals briefly gave this one-sided game a competitive edge. Le Fondre rounded Wojciech Szczesny to pull one back after 66 minutes and Kebe squeezed between two Arsenal defenders to at least give Reading some encouragement. In October when these teams last met, Arsenal recovered from 4-0 down to win an extraordinary Capital One Cup tie 7-5 in extra time, and perhaps home fans fleetingly spied revenge. But Walcott deserved a goal for his endeavours and it duly arrived with a stylish finish to end Reading hopes. Arsenal's fans appreciated his efforts and constantly urged Wenger to sort out the England attacker's contract impasse. When he departed late on, it was to a standing ovation.  Reading boss Brian McDermott: "I was very pleased with the response in the second half. Now we'll stick together and move on. "We've got to fight, no doubt about that - that's the only choice we have. "We had to do that last year, the year before that and the year before that when we were in a similar position in the Championship. "I think people have forgotten where we have come from over a short period of time. But the fans got behind us, they saw in the second half we tried to have a go and get the goals back."  Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger: "At 4-0 we had a little wobbling period, and at 4-2 of course with what happened last week we became a bit uncertain before the 5-2 killed the game. "But overall it was important to go out and play and give the right answer on the football pitch."

24.04.2013 23:34:09 Arsenal scored three in the final seven minutes as they fought back to beat Norwich and rise to third in the table. Norwich took the lead just before the hour through Michael Turner's header from a Robert Snodgrass free-kick. Mikel Arteta equalised from the spot after Kei Kamara was adjudged to have hauled over Olivier Giroud. Giroud then touched in from Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's cross before substitute Lukas Podolski drove in a third in added time. For 85 minutes, Arsene Wenger looked set to start a pivotal week for his team's Champions League hopes with a defeat. But, with games to come against Everton and Fulham before top-four rivals Tottenham are next in action against Manchester City on 21 April, his team answered plenty of questions about their quality and mental strength to secure a seventh win in eight Premier League matches. Norwich were left furious that the 86th-minute penalty given against them was awarded by linesman Richard West rather than referee Mike Jones, who was far closer to the incident. Canaries manager Chris Hughton also felt Arsenal's third should have been ruled out for offside but the truth is that his team simply fell apart after the penalty decision. After seeing what would have been a second win since 15 December turn to nothing, they remain only four points above the relegation zone. They failed to register a single effort on goal in the opening period but denied Arsenal by packing the central area. Arsenal's best opportunity came when Bacary Sagna's cross was headed against the bar by Giroud. Gervinho was also wasteful when he was picked out by a Santi Cazorla pass only to run too wide around Mark Bunn before missing the target. The impressive Norwich defender Steven Whittaker also diverted a Giroud header wide as Arsenal failed to make the most of a succession of corners just before the break. The visitors finally threatened when a deep corner from Robert Snodgrass was won by Sebastien Bassong and glanced on by Turner before being hacked clear. Turner, who appeared to catch Aaron Ramsey with a forearm in the opening period, was worked at the other end when he blocked a shot from the returning Jack Wilshere as the hosts appealed for handball. But 11 minutes into the second period, Turner pulled away from Vermaelen to glance a Snodgrass free-kick into the corner of the net. Wenger responded by throwing on Theo Walcott and Podolski but Norwich had the chance to snatch a second when Bassong broke clear and Snodgrass had a drive held by Lukasz Fabianski. Norwich keeper Bunn pushed a powerful Podolski drive onto the bar to preserve the visitors' advantage. But following an Arteta corner, West spotted a foul by Kamara on Giroud and Arteta converted his fifth penalty of the season to draw the Gunners level. Less than three minutes later, Oxlade-Chamberlain swapped passes with Podolski before clipping in a low cross that was tapped in by Giroud. In added time, Arsenal scored a third when Walcott burst down the right and pulled back for Podolski to find the bottom corner from the edge of the area.  Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger:  "I thought we wouldn't give in, and fight until the end. We have great attitude, spirit and desire and it got us there. We deserved to win but we were against a strong side and needed something special. "We have shown that we are ready for a fight. "We want consistency and that demands huge focus because you can see how quickly you're punished. We're not far away but we just have to keep winning."  Norwich manager Chris Hughton:  "A decision has gone against us that a linesman has given from 45 to 50 yards away and the referee is less than 10 yards away. "For a linesman to give it from that distance, and the third goal was offside and it was 10 yards away from him, it's almost criminal on a day that we deserved so much more. "It's not as if you'll show it back and [the referee's] view was blocked. He had a clear view and didn't give it and the linesman did and that's really tough on us. We gave a really good account of ourselves for 85 minutes. We need to bounce back but we showed a lot of character and a lot of good things."

24.04.2013 23:34:09 An uninspiring match between West Brom and West Ham ended with both earning a point from a goalless draw. Hammers defender Winston Reid fired a close-range shot over the bar in a rare first-half chance before the game improved after the break. James Morrison flicked a shot onto the West Ham crossbar, while Gary O'Neil curled an effort wide for the Hammers. Morrison was again denied by the woodwork when he headed a corner against the crossbar late on. Both sides might be happy with a point after recent stutters in form but the game made for a disappointing spectacle compared with the sparkling starts to the season both clubs had enjoyed. West Brom ended a run of three straight defeats to remain sixth, while 11th-placed West Ham, who had lost four of their preceding five league games, earned their point despite the depleted squad at manager Sam Allardyce's disposal. The Hammers boss's predicament meant he only named six substitutes rather than the permitted seven. That did not appear to bode well against a Baggies side whose tally of home points this season was the third highest in the division, behind only Manchester United and Manchester City. But West Brom struggled to show that form early on as the visitors comfortably kept their hosts at arm's length, with central defensive duo James Collins and Reid, in particular, proving a stubborn barrier. West Ham keeper Jussi Jaaskelainen was given a rare scare when Baggies striker Shane Long cut inside from the right, only for his left-footed shot to trickle a couple of yards wide. Albion's lack of invention or intensity, allied to West Ham's solidity, was making for a dour affair, and it was the visitors who came closet to opening the scoring in the first half. Collins sent a header back across West Brom's goal where Reid shot over from six yards, before Baggies keeper Boaz Myhill fended away a fierce Carlton Cole strike. The match livened up after the break and the home side went close when Zoltan Gera sent a corner back across West Ham's goal where Morrison flicked a shot onto the top of the crossbar. The home side had their own escape, with O'Neil curling a shot narrowly the wrong side of the post. West Brom began to show more urgency and Jaaskelainen had to parry a swerving Gera strike before catching the looped follow-up effort from Long. O'Brien volleyed a Mark Noble free-kick over for West Ham as they almost stole a goal from a set-piece before Morrison again struck the frame of the goal after rising highest to meet Chris Brunt's corner.  West Brom manager Steve Clarke:  "If you look at the season as a whole we have done OK. Sometimes you have to draw games. Today there were not many chances. "Both sides huffed and puffed a little bit. If you assess the game properly then I think a draw was a fair result. "I don't think either ourselves or West Ham played as well as we can. We knew today we had to stop a run of three defeats."  West Ham boss Sam Allardyce:  "Today we were a very well organised, solid and hardworking team who have shown very good defensive qualities. "Even though West Brom had a lot of territorial advantage we have come off with Jussi only having to have made a couple of saves. "It is a really good result for us. Under the circumstances with our injury list, we are very pleased. When you pick up a point with seven of your first team missing that is very pleasing. The lads who went out there did us proud and picked up a precious point."

24.04.2013 23:34:09 Jan Vertonghen's classy second-half finish sent Tottenham Hotspur back into the Premier League's top four. The Belgian defender eventually broke the deadlock at White Hart Lane, calmly turning Kyle Walker's free-kick past Gerhard Tremmel after it brushed the head of defender Ben Davies. Spurs had to work hard before breaching the visitors' well-organised defence with 15 minutes remaining. Swansea had few chances and remain 10th despite a second successive defeat. The visitors arrived in north London with a reputation for making the most of their attacking opportunities, and they had a good early chance when Jonathan de Guzman's corner found Chico Flores unmarked, only for the big Spaniard to shoot over the bar. Along with defensive partner Ashley Williams, Chico was far more impressive at the other end of the pitch as Michael Laudrup's men dug in well. First he thwarted Emmanuel Adebayor, then Swansea goalkeeper Gerhard Tremmel denied Jermain Defoe the chance to score on his 350th club appearance. The England striker was then gifted possession by Michu, who somehow recovered to block his Spurs opposite number's shot. Spurs continued to dominate, with Defoe again, Adebayor and Aaron Lennon all failing to find the net. Chances at the other end were rare, but Swansea demonstrated their attacking potential when Dwight Tiendalli whipped in a cross that almost found Wayne Routledge's head. And while Kyle Walker's powerful 35-yard shot perhaps deserved more than to be parried away by Tremmel, Michu may have felt similarly disappointed when his instinctive long-range effort cleared the Tottenham crossbar. The game continued in similar fashion after the break, Defoe setting Walker free on the right only for the Spurs defender to shoot wide. Just when it seemed the breakthrough would never come, the home side's perseverance finally paid off when Walker, via Swans defender Davies, found Vertonghen, who spun on his heels before guiding the ball into the bottom corner. Tremmel again denied Defoe after he was put clear by former Swan Gylfi Sigurdsson before Michu, chasing a bouncing through-ball, collided heavily with home keeper Hugo Lloris. As he lay in the Spurs penalty area, the home side pressed forward, much to the fury of Laudrup's men and the visiting supporters. But while Michu recovered, Swansea could not and Tottenham took all three points.  Tottenham manager Andre Villas-Boas: "It was hard work but the one team who were going to win was us with 23 shots and so much possession. Swansea came out on the counter well and the result was uncertain at 0-0 but we deserved to get the result. "It was difficult. Michu was defending in his half and it was difficult to break them down. We kept focus and were patient. I'm very happy with the speed we played. "It was very important. It gets us back to fourth place. The table is tight but it was good to give something back to the fans at White Hart Lane."  Swansea City manager Michael Laudrup: "We knew that we were up against a very good side, one of the best in the league. "We knew if we came to half-time still 0-0 or not conceding we would have a big possibility of taking something away from here. "In the second half they weren't that dangerous so the goal was disappointing. It's not a game where I can say I'm disappointed because we did not play well. We did what we had to do."

24.04.2013 23:34:09 Liverpool were left stunned after their hopes of challenging for a top-four spot were hit by a loss to Aston Villa. The home side went behind against the run of play when Christian Benteke arrowed a shot in off the post. Benteke's backheel set up Andreas Weimann for Villa's second, before the Reds were denied a penalty when Ciaran Clark pulled Daniel Agger's shirt. Benteke made it three from close range for a resurgent Villa before Steven Gerrard netted a late consolation goal. It was a second defeat in 12 games for Liverpool and will serve as a reality check to their growing levels of optimism and expectancy that they might be able to launch an assault on the Champions League places. Reds boss Brendan Rodgers had even claimed he was looking higher than fourth place but those comments came back to haunt him after his side were beaten by an improving and youthful Villa, who extended their unbeaten league run to five games to move up to 14th place. The Midlands side had reached the Capital One Cup semi-finals with a midweek win at Norwich and they translated that form to Anfield, with the finishing prowess of strike duo Benteke and Weimann showing Liverpool what they are missing. The match had got under way following a minute's applause for former Liverpool captain and manager Phil Taylor, who passed away recently aged 95. When the action did start, the home side were quickly given a wake-up call when Benteke headed a Barry Bannan free-kick straight at Reds keeper Pepe Reina. Liverpool took this as the cue to take a grip of the game as they passed and probed for openings, although their lack of a clinical edge in the final third let them down. This was epitomised when Luis Suarez could have put Gerrard clean through on goal, only for the Uruguayan to put his pass behind his captain's surging run. Even though the ball was quickly worked back to Gerrard, he sent his 12-yard shot straight at keeper Brad Guzan. Liverpool again had the Villa goal in sight when Suarez robbed left-back Chris Herd of possession before laying the ball off to Jonjo Shelvey, who had the ball cleared off his toes by a last-ditch Nathan Baker tackle. Having provided a warning to the Merseysiders when Weimann had earlier broken clear before being shepherded wide and then tackled by Reina, Villa shocked their hosts after 29 minutes. Brett Holman laid the ball off to Benteke and, afforded time and space, the Belgian fired a low 22-yard shot in off the post. Weimann put an effort onto the roof of the net as he almost capitalised on Liverpool right-back Glen Johnson's poor back-header, before the Villa striker did extend his side's lead. Weimann and Benteke beautifully combined and the latter's backheel allowed the former to sweep a shot past Reina. Rodgers brought on Joe Cole for Shelvey at half-time and, while Liverpool had a decent claim for a penalty turned down for Clark's shirt-pulling of Agger, the home side rarely threatened a comeback. Instead, Cole gave the ball away and Benteke waltzed through the gaping defence of the Merseysiders before slotting home a close-range shot. Gerrard did find a way past Villa keeper Guzan with a header from Johnson's shot but it was too little, too late.  Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers:  "We probably got punished for our decision-making in that first 20 minutes, we were a bit careless. "We could easily have been 3-0 up in the game and if we do that we can control it much better but we didn't have that final pass and bit of quality at the top end of the field. "Then we went on to concede some poor goals. We weren't quite at it today with our intensity and pressure in the game and they were a threat on the counter-attack and got the goals."  Aston Villa boss Paul Lambert:  "The whole performance was fabulous. The goals were excellent, as was the way we defended. "I thought we were excellent. The goals were brilliant, the second goal, with the movement and the backheel, especially. "Benteke has been unbelievable while Andi Weimann knows where the goal is. He's a natural finisher. His enthusiasm and work ethic are second to none."  Liverpool 1-3 Aston Villa

24.04.2013 23:34:09 Manchester United produced a ruthless attacking display at Old Trafford to ensure they will top the Premier League table this Christmas. Two goals in four first-half minutes ultimately decided this as a contest, with Robin van Persie and Tom Cleverley firing in to put Sir Alex Ferguson's side firmly in control. Wayne Rooney tapped in from close range to make it 3-0 just before the hour mark but Sunderland kept fighting and deservedly pulled a goal back through substitute and former United striker Fraizer Campbell. The result maintains United's six-point lead over Manchester City. Having seen the title go to the club which has topped the table at Christmas in each of the past three seasons, this display will no doubt add to their growing belief. Martin O'Neill faces a far more difficult festive period. The Sunderland manager may retain the firm backing of the club's decision-makers but only three victories from their last 25 league matches brings its own pressures, especially considering the fact that three of their next four games are against Manchester City, Tottenham Hotspur and Liverpool. The history books had suggested it might be a long day for the visitors. Their last victory at Old Trafford came on 11 May, 1968 - a day Manchester City pipped United to the league title. United had endured the same painful outcome when the clubs last met in May. Ferguson and his players had not forgotten the reaction of the Sunderland fans when news of City's late goals reached the Stadium of Light, and it showed. This was an dominant display, inspired by Michael Carrick in midfield, Ashley Young's prodigious work on the wings, sublime finishing by Van Persie and a workrate and ambition that was, at times, a sight to behold. It was a performance that added weight to the argument that last week's Manchester derby was more than just a localised tremor. With United in this form and Nemanja Vidic available to shore up a leaky defence, the hope among those at Old Trafford is that perhaps it was the first signs of a seismic shift back towards the red half of Manchester. Even accounting for the poverty of the football coming the other way, United's attacking play was rapier sharp, their finishing ruthless. For all Sunderland's energy and dedication late on, they were simply outclassed and outpassed for too much of this contest. The damage was done in four first-half minutes, as United warmed to their task. Young was a constant menace, tormenting Carlos Cuellar with a series of lung-busting runs, full of twists and turns. One such surge down the left took him to the bye-line where he shrugged off a muscular challenge by Cuellar, twisted beyond Sebastian Larsson and crossed. The ball deflected off John O'Shea's leg, Van Persie killed it with his first touch and sent it high beyond Sunderland goalkeeper Simon Mignolet with his second. Simple but sublime. A second goal soon followed, as Cleverley swept a curling shot in from just inside the penalty area after a delightful exchange with Carrick. Rooney, who was always on the same wavelength as Van Persie, was finding space with alarming regularity and might have scored two of his own. One volleyed effort flashed inches wide from the Dutchman's clever knock-down. Another to stand out was Phil Jones, whose running from deep with tireless energy and ambition constantly challenged the visitors. And yet Sunderland, driven on by O'Neill who didn't leave the touchline, kept pushing. James McClean might have done better having robbed Rio Ferdinand but only shoot straight at David De Gea from a narrow angle, while Patrice Evra headed Stephane Sessegnon's shot over the bar. Substitute Conor Wickham tested De Gea, as did a deflected McClean effort but the game was decided just before the hour mark when Rooney and Van Persie combined again to devastating effect. Young freed the Netherlands international on the left of the penalty area, who tricked his way beyond Cuellar and Titus Bramble before squaring to Rooney who tapped in. The game all but settled, United were able to bring Vidic into the action after three months on the sidelines with a knee injury. Three minutes later, Sunderland scored when Campbell rose majestically at the back post to head in Sessegnon's clever cross from the left. Wickham tested De Gea again as full-time approached, a reminder to Ferguson that for all his side's attacking verve, their weakness at the back will need to be addressed if they are to regain the title at the first time of asking.

24.04.2013 23:34:09 Wes Hoolahan's fine individual display helped Norwich beat Wigan 2-1 to extend their unbeaten league run to 10 games. The Irishman created one and scored another against a Wigan side who remain in the Premier League's bottom three. His hard work set up Anthony Pilkington to fire home at the near post after 15 minutes, before Shaun Maloney equalised with a long-range effort. Pilkington then turned provider as Hoolahan's emphatic header sent Norwich into the top half of the table. Following an unbeaten run that goes back to the start of October, Norwich are now only two points shy of a place in the top four. Wigan were unable to reproduce their usual flowing style, and the first 15 minutes served up little by way of entertainment or goalmouth action. The only spark came from Hoolahan, who repeatedly dropped deep to find space in the congested midfield. After pleasing the crowd with a few flicks, the 30-year-old showed there was far more to his game than some pretty touches. Emerson Boyce dwelt on the ball too long before Hoolahan pounced and quickly spotted Pilkington's run down the pitch. His through-ball was magnificent, allowing the forward to take a touch before hammering his shot high past Ali Al-Habsi, who could only get a hand to it. Pilkington and Al-Habsi were the main protagonists in the remainder of the first half. First, the Norwich man blasted wide after the goalkeeper spilled a routine catch, then the Omani made amends with a magnificent one-handed save from Robert Snodgrass's header. Roberto Martinez brought on Shaun Maloney and David Jones at half-time for the injured James McCarthy and the ineffective Jordi Gomez. The double switch paid dividends almost immediately, as Maloney scored Wigan's first away goal since Ben Watson's winner at Tottenham on 3 November. James McArthur's neat ball out wide found Arouna Kone, who rolled the ball to the edge of the box. Maloney opened up his body and struck across the ball, angling it away from Mark Bunn and into the far corner. Buoyed by their equaliser, Wigan were enjoying their best period of the game. Mauro Boselli, making his first Premier league start since December 2010, had a decent chance but failed to convert Maloney's deep cross. Parity only lasted 13 minutes however, with Hoolahan grabbing a goal befitting his overall performance. Pilkington twisted away from Emmerson Boyce down the left hand side before finding Hoolahan, who perfectly guided his header past Al-Habsi in front of the watching Republic of Ireland assistant manager Marco Tardelli. The goal really calmed the home side down. As their midfield diamond sparkled, the Canaries were twice more denied by Al-Habsi, most impressively when he deflected Pilkington's close-range shot away with a strong right hand. Wigan did have one last chance though, when Kone went close in stoppage time. His effort was bravely blocked by Sebastien Bassong, but an equaliser would have been unjust on Norwich and Hoolahan.  Norwich City manager Chris Hughton:  "It is not being negative, but for a club like ourselves, it is about keeping as big a gap as you can between us [and those at the bottom]. "There is no shame in saying that, it is a reality for clubs like ourselves. "But our form at the moment has deserved it. "We are a team which has to work very hard for the points we get, so there will be no getting carried away."  Wigan manager Roberto Martinez:  "Our start was sluggish and pedestrian, we were very, very, poor and had our goalkeeper to thank for keeping us in the game. "The second half was very different, we started to control the game and Norwich had to start to defend. "We scored a beautiful goal and were starting to build positive momentum, so our disappointment is the smallest man on the pitch gets a free header in the six-yard box. "I felt with our second-half performance we merited something out of the game, but it was a self-inflicted defeat."  Martinez on Bradley Johnson's challenge on James McCarthy, which forced the midfielder off at half-time:  "It is one of those actions you don't want to see. James McCarthy has been in good form, and they took him out of the game, which is very disappointing. "It is his ankle ligaments, we will X-ray it and get the results from the scans very shortly, but I doubt if he will be available for the next 10 days."

24.04.2013 23:34:09 Adel Taarabt's double ended Queens Park Rangers' record-breaking winless start to a Premier League season as they beat Fulham in an engaging London derby. The playmaker opened the scoring with a shot from 25 yards that flicked off defender Brede Hangeland. While the 23-year-old's first owed much to luck, his sensational second saw him nonchalantly curl the ball into the net following a mazy run from midfield. Mladen Petric's deflected strike late on ensured a nervy climax for QPR. The victory was their first of the campaign at the 17th time of asking, halting a run of three consecutive draws since Harry Redknapp took charge in November following the dismissal of Mark Hughes. It also moves them above Reading and off the bottom of the table for the     QPR started the brighter and could have gone ahead in the second minute after recalled striker Djibril Cisse was put through on goal following a glorious through ball from Taarabt. The Frenchman's scuffed shot was saved easily by Mark Schwarzer, though he had room to complain to referee Martin Atkinson after his progress was impeded by a pull-back from defender Aaron Hughes. That chance failed to wake Fulham from their stupor and their dozy start should have been punished when John Arne Riise played a blind pass back to Schwarzer, but Jamie Mackie somehow contrived to place wide from six yards when it looked easier to score. A furious-looking Martin Jol watched on as his side's lack of concentration was to blame again when Chris Baird felled Stephane Mbia just outside the area following a loose pass from Hughes, but Cisse and Taarabt wasted the resulting free-kick. The Dutchman's mood was not helped after the break when Fulham deservedly fell behind as Taarabt's run went unchecked. He broke from deep and hit a tame shot that, luckily for the hosts, took a hefty deflection off Hangeland and trickled into the net past the stranded Schwarzer. Soon after, the error-strewn Baird was caught in possession just outside his own penalty box, but his mistake went unpunished as Cisse curled his shot just past Schwarzer's left post. Taarabt was continuing to light up a match which was devoid of much inspiration elsewhere, and his stunning second goal saw him push through the gigantic figure of Hangeland before playfully flicking the top of the ball to create the space to slide in an unstoppable shot along the ground with the outside of his boot. Fulham had not provided any attacking threat as strikers Dimitar Berbatov and Hugo Rodallega struggled to replicate the form they showed in Monday night's 2-1 victory against Newcastle United.  It was left to substitute Petric to finally find a way past Robert Green, his shot from outside the box looping off midfielder Alejandro Faurlin's boot and beyond the keeper's reach. That moment of good fortune enticed the visitors to push on at the death, but they were unable to create an undeserved equaliser to deny QPR a vital three points.

24.04.2013 23:34:09 Kenwyne Jones scored his first goal in 28 Premier League appearances as Stoke drew with Everton to maintain their unbeaten home league record. Potters captain Ryan Shawcross headed Steven Pienaar's cross into his own net to give Everton a first-half lead. Leon Osman had a chance to make it 2-0 but shot wide before Jones headed in an equaliser from Shawcross's angled pass. Everton could have been reduced to 10 men when Marouane Fellaini headbutted Shawcross but the incident was missed. However, Fellaini could still face disciplinary action with Everton manager David Moyes later admitting he expected the Belgian international to be banned. Everton made a bright start as Darron Gibson threaded a ball to the overlapping Seamus Coleman, whose pull-back found Nikica Jelavic, but the striker's effort was blocked by Shawcross. The visitors then had a penalty appeal turned down as Pienaar's shot hit Glenn Whelan's arm, but referee Mark Halsey was not interested. Stoke's Matthew Etherington dragged an effort wide of the post and Jones shot wildly over the crossbar from 25 yards. The Potters' best chance of the first half came after Etherington's deep corner was headed back across goal by Jon Walters, but Steven Nzonzi's weak header from only five yards out was straight at Tim Howard. Everton nearly made their hosts pay as Gibson's intelligent pass over the top found Steven Naismith. The Scot lifted the ball over the onrushing Asmir Begovic but Shawcross cleared it off the line. Stoke's next chance came when Etherington, who swapped wings with Walters, put in an excellent cross from the right wing, which Howard, playing in his 200th consecutive Premier League game, had to punch away. But Everton took the lead when Pienaar's cross was headed into his own net by Shawcross, only the third goal Stoke had conceded at home in the league in 2012-13. The Potters, who have kept eight clean sheets this season and have the best defensive record in the league, should have fallen 2-0 behind. Leighton Baines pulled the ball back to an unmarked Osman but the England midfielder dragged his effort wide from 12 yards. That miss proved costly for the Toffees as Stoke equalised seven minutes into the second half through Jones, who outjumped Phil Jagielka to head in from Shawcross's diagonal ball in from the halfway line. Jones, who had not scored in the Premier League since August 2011, nearly grabbed his second in five minutes when he collected Glenn Whelan's pass, held off a challenge from Baines and hit the post from a tight angle. As the game wore on, Stoke had the best chances to grab a winner. Cameron Jerome burst through but was denied by Howard and substitute Peter Crouch was unable to convert the rebound, Sylvain Distin intervening to clear. The final whistle ensured Everton's eighth draw in 11 matches, a result that leaves the Toffees fourth, while Stoke remain ninth.  Everton manager David Moyes said:  "We dug in and got a hard-fought point. "Stoke are a good team, they make it difficult and anyone who comes here will find it difficult but we had a wonderful chance to make it 2-0. "Leon Osman missed a great chance, we should have stopped their goal and we were a bit fortunate that Stoke did not get the winner."  Stoke manager Tony Pulis said:  "The first half was very even but they got the goal off the top of Ryan's head. They had a great chance to kill the game and if they had scored then it would've been a different match. "We were let off and I told the lads at half-time to go and give it a blast in the second half and we had four other great opportunities to score a second. "We've had chances in all of our games but we need to put the ball into the net more."

24.04.2013 23:34:09 Manchester City bounced back from the disappointment of losing the Manchester derby with a stylish victory over Newcastle United at St James' Park. Sergio Aguero opened the scoring with a close-range finish after being set up by Samir Nasri, who hit the post 10 minutes later. Javi Garcia made it 2-0 from David Silva's corner before Demba Ba's header after the break gave the Magpies hope. But Yaya Toure's seven-yard finish from Pablo Zabaleta's pass sealed victory. It was the perfect response from Roberto Mancini's side after the bitter disappointment of losing 3-2 at home to neighbours Manchester United last Sunday. Robin van Persie's injury-time winner, which earned United a six-point cushion at the Premier League summit, had raised questions about City's character. Mancini responded to the defeat against United by making three changes - Mario Balotelli failing to even make the substitutes bench as the City manager opted to play Carlos Tevez alongside Argentine compatriot Aguero for the first time since the 5-0 win over Aston Villa on 17 November. And the change immediately paid off as Aguero side-footed his side into a 10th minute lead in front of a gaping net after Yaya Toure's defence-splitting pass allowed Nasri to tee up the City striker for his sixth Premier League goal of the season. There was also a place in the side for Kolo Toure but it was the performance of younger brother Yaya that really caught the eye. Yaya produced a colossal performance, the Ivory Coast international leading by example as stand-in captain in the absence of Vincent Kompany, who was nursing a groin injury. City were dynamic going forward, the only negative for Mancini before half-time being the loss of Nasri to a groin injury. The sight of Nasri, who hit the post from inside the six-yard area in the 20th minute, vanishing down the tunnel in the 37th minute was a welcome one for Newcastle, who failed to deal with the Frenchman's pace while Tevez and Aguero were also allowed to roam at will. Aguero had a shot cleared off the line by Mike Williamson, while Tevez was denied by Magpies' keeper Tim Krul. Garcia then doubled the lead six minutes before half-time with a header from Silva's corner which Davide Santon should have cleared off the line. Six minutes into the second half Demba Ba gave the hosts hope when he headed beyond Joe Hart, who was standing well off his line, after Fabricio Coloccini hooked the ball into the area but City capped a classy performance through man of the match Yaya Toure. He slid home from seven yards after Silva had fed Zabaleta on the left side of the penalty area and the full-back pulled the ball back for Yaya Toure.

24.04.2013 23:34:09 Martin O'Neill celebrated a year in charge at Sunderland with an important victory over Reading that lifts the Black Cats out of the relegation zone. O'Neill's side got the best possible start when James McClean fired in on the turn with just three minutes gone. And they strengthened their grip on the game when Steven Fletcher back-heeled Danny Rose's cross in from eight yards. Sunderland's dominance continued and Stephane Sessegnon's finish added a fitting late flourish to their night. Exactly a year ago, O'Neill oversaw a 2-1 home win over Blackburn in his first game as Sunderland boss - the first of seven victories in 10 games that convinced Black Cats fans they had found the ideal man to restore their flagging fortunes. The general feeling at the Stadium of Light in the aftermath of this result - just a fifth win in 30 games - will be less one of unbridled optimism and more one of relief as their side claimed just a second home league win of the season to move up to 15th in the table. However, the Sunderland support will also take heart from a performance that showcased the kind of desire and positivity their side have been lacking over a 10-month period that has left them little better off now in terms of league position than they were 365 days ago. O'Neill's side demonstrated attacking intent from the off - something they were rewarded for in the third minute with McClean's neat finish from just inside the box after Royals keeper Adam Federici had punched away Adam Johnson's corner - and maintained their commitment to the cause during the rare periods Reading came back into the contest. Fletcher's seventh goal of the season - an improvised finish as Rose's cross reached him with his back to goal - proved to be the game's decisive moment as it provided the home side with a lead too great to be overhauled by an industrious but blunt Reading side. The game could have been over as a contest at the break had Sebastian Larsson or Sessegnon shown a touch more accuracy with their shooting from range or Fletcher been able to keep his header from a corner down. It could have been a different story had Alex Pearce not put his shot from close range past the post with the score at 1-0 or had Nicky Shorey not been denied by Simon Mignolet with a 20-yard free-kick in the second half that would have set home nerves jangling. The visitors only other significant chance came in the closing stages when Noel Hunt's close-range header from a corner was clawed away by the Sunderland keeper just minutes before Sessegnon ran clear of the Royals defence and rounded Federici before finishing. Instead, Royals boss Brian McDermott is left to reflect on a fifth straight league defeat and a return of just two points from nine away games that leaves his side six points from safety. Reading chairman John Madejski has already rejected as "totally absurd" the suggestions that McDermott will be sacked but unless the 51-year-old unearths some quality to match his side's effort he will be overseeing their return to the Championship in May. Thanks in part to their superior budget, Sunderland possess the requisite talent to keep them in this division but if O'Neill is to make more progress in his second year than his first the Black Cats board may need to fulfil his wish for further additions in January.

24.04.2013 23:34:09 Fulham ended a run of seven matches without victory by claiming a hard-fought win over struggling Newcastle. Steve Sidwell put the Cottagers ahead with a deflected shot - their first goal in over five hours of football. Newcastle levelled when Hatem Ben Arfa beat home keeper Mark Schwarzer with a dipping effort from 25 yards. But Hugo Rodallega's close-range header ensured the home side claimed a win that moves them three points ahead of United in the Premier League table. Both these teams have reason to be disappointed with their season so far with Newcastle's injury and suspension-riddled campaign a shadow of their impressive previous one and Fulham's promising start to 2012-13 having tailed off dramatically in recent weeks. It was no surprise then that this game was a closely-contested affair, with mistakes proving as decisive to the outcome as fluency and skill. Fulham produced the greater amount of the latter and fewer of the former. Damien Duff clearly had the bit between his teeth and was a regular threat to his ex-club with direct runs and accurate deliveries from either wing, while Dimitar Berbatov was typically intelligent in his movement and touch. The Cottagers did not have it all their own way - particularly during a 20-minute spell either side of the Newcastle goal - but demonstrated an appetite for the cause that will assist their desire to rise up the table. Newcastle boosted their flagging season with a much-needed victory over Wigan last Monday, but seven days later it is clear they have much more work to do if the corner is to be turned. It was another disjointed performance from Alan Pardew's side, who too often failed to get their most dangerous attacking players on the ball in areas where they could hurt the home side. Demba Ba was isolated in attack, fellow striker Papiss Cisse - who scored 13 goals in 14 games for Newcastle last season but has only four in 20 this campaign - was wasted in a role that saw him operate largely on the right while Ben Arfa showed clear glimpses of his talent but is not yet up to speed after missing four games through injury. They remain without an away win all season and still uncomfortably close to the relegation zone. They were on the back foot from the off and deservedly fell behind when Sidwell's first-time shot from Duff's pass looped up off the knee of Mike Williamson and found the net via the underside of the crossbar. They should have trailed by more at the break but twice Berbatov was foiled - the first time by a good save from Tim Krul after the striker had run clear of the defence and the second by a defender on the line from a close-range shot. Newcastle were more of a threat after the break and levelled when Ben Arfa caught Schwarzer out with a shot from 25 yards that looped into the net off the toe of a defender. However, Fulham battled back and reclaimed the lead when poor marking allowed Rodallega to head home unmarked from Duff's free-kick. Both sides subsequently hit the woodwork - Fabricio Coloccini curling a shot against the post from range and Mladen Petric striking the corner of the goal-frame from 20 yards - but no further goals came to leave Fulham delighted and Newcastle crestfallen.  Fulham manager Martin Jol: "It was a vital win. If you lose this game you get in a depression and we didn't want that. "It wasn't easy, although if you look at the chances we had we should have finished it off a lot earlier. "I was happy that [Dimitar] Berbatov, after talking to him, could fill in that role [behind the striker]. It was vital, he didn't score so that was disappointing, but on the other hand he linked us up and kept the team together - I was very happy with him."

24.04.2013 23:34:09 Aston Villa remain precariously placed in the battle against relegation after being held to a draw by Fulham. Both teams had wasted chances before Charles N'Zogbia deservedly put Villa ahead when he curled in a shot. But the home side's Fabian Delph glanced Bryan Ruiz's corner into his own net to gift Fulham an equaliser. Delph had a chance to atone for his error only for the midfielder to sky a far-post shot after the visitors failed to clear an Andreas Weimann cross. The anxious faces among the Villa crowd as the final whistle closed in were a sign of the trouble their side are in as they lie only three points above the drop zone. Villa may feel they did enough to beat Fulham but had to settle for a draw ahead of testing games against league leaders Manchester United and fellow strugglers Sunderland. The Cottagers reached the 40-point mark, which should be enough to secure their safety, after a game in which their keeper Mark Schwarzer stood out. It had not started well for the home side as they suffered a setback prior to kick-off when striker Gabriel Agbonlahor, who had three goals in his last four games, was ruled out with a thigh injury. But there was plenty of intent and industry from Villa early on, with their efforts finally culminating in a first real chance after nearly 25 minutes. Weimann whipped in a cross for fellow striker Christian Benteke, who steered a side-footed volley narrowly wide. During a spell of Villa pressure, N'Zogbia's first-time shot from a Benteke cross was also palmed away by keeper Schwarzer. The home side were showing plenty of ambition but the visitors almost took the lead on the counter-attack. Midfielder Eyong Enoh left Jordan Bowery in his wake and pulled a ball back which Dimitar Berbatov drove wide from just inside the area. However, Schwarzer was still the busier keeper and the Australian was again called upon when he palmed a long-range N'Zogbia strike over his goal. The keeper again frustrated the Midlands side when he parried away a Weimann shot before, down the other end, Fulham's Ruiz slid a piercing pass through to Berbatov. But the Bulgarian striker, who only had Brad Guzan to beat, was denied by the outside of the home keeper's post. The miss was punished when N'Zogbia latched onto a poor Brede Hangeland clearance before bending a left-foot shot past Schwarzer. However, the lead was short-lived as Delph - trying to clear Ruiz's corner at the near post - inadvertently headed into his own net. The midfielder could have salvaged his blushes late on but sent a far-post shot over from close range as the spoils were shared.  Aston Villa manager Paul Lambert:  "I thought we were great. We should have been a few goals up at half-time and their goalkeeper made some vital saves. I could not fault the lads for effort. "[In terms of Fabian Delph's own goal] you can never fault anyone for trying to do the right things. "It [the point] keeps the momentum there. I played under a great manager once and he said if you can't win a game then don't lose it. I think you can sense in the stadium the fans are behind us."  Fulham boss Martin Jol:  "I thought they were the better team. In the first half, we were a bit hot and cold. The chances they had were created by us. "If you look at the match, they had won three of four coming into the game, so I can live with a point. "Our first priority was 40 points and we have achieved that."

24.04.2013 23:34:09 Liverpool scored two goals in three second-half minutes as they fought back from 2-1 down to beat West Ham thanks to a late James Collins own goal. The Reds took an early lead through a spectacular Glen Johnson strike. Mark Noble equalised from the spot after Joe Allen handled and Steven Gerrard headed into his own net to put the Hammers ahead at half-time. But Joe Cole made it 2-2 with an angled drive before Jordan Henderson's cross span in off Collins at the near post. Eight days ago, West Ham turned round a half-time deficit to beat Chelsea but this time it was Sam Allardyce's side who were on the wrong end of a stirring second-half comeback. This was the first time in nine attempts this season that Liverpool have won a league game immediately after a Europa League tie. But it was an especially unlikely Reds recovery - not only had they toiled in attack just before their late burst of goals, they nicked the points despite being without the suspended Luis Suarez, their only fit striker. The absence of Suarez did not seem to matter when Johnson put Liverpool ahead in spectacular style after 11 minutes. Gerrard spread the ball to Johnson on the right, who cut inside before turning back on to his right foot and rifling a ferocious drive beyond Jussi Jaaskelainen and into the top corner. That meant Johnson has now scored in his last three league games against his former club, and he appeared keen add to that tally whenever he picked up the ball. Another one of his raids down the same flank saw him leave Matt Jarvis in his wake before teeing up Raheem Sterling who screwed a shot wide. Jarvis was clearly struggling to fulfil his defensive duties but he fared much better when his side came forward. From one of his crosses, Mohamed Diame had a shot deflected wide off his own team-mate Carlton Cole, and from another, Daniel Agger had to stretch to stop Cole from turning home. By now, it was Liverpool under pressure but their resistance was ended in controversial circumstances after 35 minutes. Agger cleared another Jarvis delivery as far as Guy Demel, whose fierce first-time shot hit Allen's arm at point-blank range. Referee Lee Probert pointed to the spot and Noble stepped up to slot his penalty into the bottom corner beyond Pepe Reina's dive. Probert did not endear himself any further to the travelling fans when he chose only to caution Matt Taylor for a high and wild challenge on Sterling soon afterwards. And things got even worse for the visitors when Gerrard headed a Jarvis cross into his own net just before the break. There seemed no chance of any sort of turnaround as West Ham continued to press in the second half and Liverpool's passing game deserted them when they found themselves near the home side's penalty area. Shelvey, who was having a frustrating time as Suarez's replacement in the Reds' attack, saw a deflected shot tipped over and steered a header wide. But, just as against the Blues last weekend, Diame's participation was to prove decisive. Against Chelsea his introduction off the bench changed the game - this time a hamstring injury that forced him off did likewise. Liverpool began to find a foothold in midfield and drew level thanks to another Hammers old boy - Joe Cole providing a precise finish from Sterling's slipped pass. Three minutes later, Collins lunged in to beat Jonjo Shelvey to a low front-post cross from Jordan Henderson but the ball looped off his leg and over Jaaskelainen into the net. From looking comfortable, West Ham were left chasing the game and, despite them pumping a series of balls into Reina's area, they were unable to rescue a point.  West Ham manager Sam Allardyce: "We were never in control of the game completely especially against a side like Liverpool, we were not going to dominate for the whole game. "We gave everything we could. We can't continue to play and dominate teams we play, when we did today we got ourselves in the lead. "We just got promoted, we are in a good run of form and there are expectations from fans "  Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers on Jonjo Shelvey's role as stand-in striker: "In this country it is always a very traditional target man, a clear number nine. "Give credit to Carlton Cole today, I know him from my time at Chelsea, he is a real handful and was outstanding today. "But you see young Jonjo at 20 years of age playing the number nine role in a different way - dropping into midfield and combining with the midfield players to make the fourth man, being a threat when he is in around the box, showing great feet and I thought he was outstanding today the kid."

24.04.2013 23:34:09 Two goals in stoppage time produced a dramatic late turnaround at Goodison Park as Everton beat Tottenham to move into fourth spot in the Premier League. Spurs appeared to be on their way to victory courtesy of Clint Dempsey's deflected 76th-minute strike. Gylfi Sigurdsson then hit the Toffees crossbar with a shot before Steven Pienaar header in against his former club to equalise after 90 minutes. Nikica Jelavic then turned in a close-range shot for Everton's winner. Spurs, without the buccaneering Gareth Bale through injury, thought they had produced a classic away performance, having soaked up the home side's pressure before taking the lead through one of their rare forays forward. But Everton had a sting in their tail and extended their unbeaten run at Goodison Park to 12 games with a late rally which saw them leapfrog their opponents into the Champions League places on goal difference. Toffees manager David Moyes was favourite to take over at Tottenham at one point during the summer prior to Andre Villas-Boas entering the fray and taking over as boss of the White Hart Lane outfit. The pair shared a hug before the game but, if Moyes had any point to make to the London club's hierarchy, his side certainly began with the intent and industry to try to make it for him. Home midfielder Leon Osman had an early shot blocked after Pienaar, who returned to Goodison Park last January after a move to Spurs did not work out, cushioned a header into his path. The visitors settled but, although Everton were looking the most dangerous, a combination of last-ditch defending, a smart save from keeper Hugo Lloris and lack of cutting edge in the final third held the home side at bay. Lloris quickly came out of his goal to palm the ball away from the feet of Jelavic when the striker was put through on goal. Spurs defender William Gallas also crucially intercepted a Kevin Mirallas cross in front of a waiting Jelavic, while Seamus Coleman sent an angled effort into the side-netting before Osman sent a shot across goal. Everton also had two handball shouts against Dempsey and Gallas but neither were conclusive enough for referee Kevin Friend to award a penalty. Spurs usually have a stylish swagger to their play but they were showing they could also put in a workmanlike performance as they frustrated their hosts. Toffees midfielder Steven Naismith came on after the break and he immediately had a chance. Leighton Baines fired in a shot at goal after his free-kick had come back off the Tottenham wall but Naismith side-footed the off-target effort wide from eight yards. Everton were punished for not making the most of their possession when Dempsey's long range shot went in via a deflection off centre-back Sylvain Distin. It was a body blow for the home side but, after Spurs substitute Sigurdsson's shot hit the crossbar, the home side showed the character and spirit they are renowned for when Pienaar powered a ferocious header in from a Seamus Coleman cross. Spurs barely had time to reflect on the equaliser before Apostolos Vellios's overhead kick fell for Jelavic to score the winner from eight yards, with Moyes coming on to the pitch in celebration.  Everton manager David Moyes:  "It is as good a finish as we've had. We've had a few like that where we've lost and felt low so we were due one. "The position [fourth place] doesn't shame the way the players have been playing, they have been doing that well. "But we could quite easily have slipped out and been in the bottom half of the league. It feels good today but we have to make sure we maintain that."  Tottenham boss Andre Villas-Boas:  "It was a disappointing result bearing in mind we were leading taking the game into the last minute. "It has been quite an adventure in the Premier League this season; if we count the number of results that have been going for us before the last minutes we would be first. "There are so many different reasons. It is not really easy to explain because a couple of them come from different situations. "It is something we are aware of, which is why we speak about it openly, and it is something we have to improve, seeing off games."

24.04.2013 23:34:09 Robin van Persie's injury-time winner sent Manchester United six points clear at the top of the Premier League after a stormy derby win against Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium. Wayne Rooney's two first-half goals put the leaders in control against the reigning champions - but Yaya Toure and Pablo Zabaleta put City level as the game entered its closing moments. Van Persie, who City manager Roberto Mancini admitted he wanted to sign before his Â£24m summer move from Arsenal to Old Trafford, then demonstrated his worth with his 14th goal of the season as his free-kick deflected off Samir Nasri and beyond a stretching Joe Hart. Ugly scenes followed, United's Rio Ferdinand suffering a cut eye as he appeared to be struck by an object thrown during the celebrations and City keeper Joe Hart having to restrain a pitch invader as he advanced towards the defender. The incident marred a magnificent game in which the hosts turned around a poor first-half display and threatened to earn a point - especially after Mario Balotelli was replaced by Carlos Tevez - until Van Persie's dramatic intervention. United were overjoyed at a result that gives them a stranglehold on the title race, with Rooney taking his tally to a record 10 derby goals. But it capped a miserable week for City after the conclusion of their abject Champions League campaign. Van Persie's strike ended the Blues' unbeaten home Premier League run stretching back to a 2-1 defeat by Everton in December 2010.  Mancini had taken a giant leap of faith in selecting Balotelli ahead of Tevez and it was a decision that was not rewarded. The Italian striker skied a good chance in some early phases of home domination but City were undone by that brilliant counter-attacking opener from Rooney. Van Persie and Ashley Young both played important parts in an attack that swept forward from goalkeeper David de Gea's clearance and Rooney finished the job. His shot may have been scuffed but his intention to wrong-foot Hart was clear. City were further frustrated as captain Vincent Kompany limped off and was replaced by Kolo Toure, who was surprisingly preferred to England defender Joleon Lescott, also on the bench. The visitors' width was troubling City and was pivotal as they extended their lead just before the half-hour. Rafael made inroads down the right and crossed for Rooney to sweep another precise finish past Hart for his 150th Premier League goal. Balotelli had made no impact on the game and it was no surprise when he was replaced by Tevez in the opening moments of the second half after a needless backheel conceded possession and brought a frustrated response from Mancini. The departing striker shot Mancini a glare as he strode straight down the tunnel but he could have no complaints after being given an opportunity he had singularly failed to take. United then thought they had scored a third when Young converted from close range after Van Persie had struck the upright but the linesman's flag was raised for a very marginal offside decision. Seconds later City were back in business as Yaya Toure scored after Tevez and David Silva had seen efforts blocked. As the champions sensed an equaliser, United had a remarkable escape in the 79th minute when Silva turned inside only for his angled effort to skim off De Gea's shoulder on to the bar. The leveller came in the 85th minute when United could only half-clear Tevez's corner and Zabaleta drilled home powerfully from 12 yards. Mancini's men pushed forward in search of a stunning victory but the points went to United when Tevez brought down Rafael and Van Persie scored with a free-kick from an angle, aided by a crucial deflection.

24.04.2013 23:34:09 Mikel Arteta arrested Arsenal's recent slide as he scored two penalties to steer his side to a win over West Brom. The midfielder's first spot-kick came after Steven Reid was controversially adjudged to have fouled Santi Cazorla. The visitors thought they should have had a penalty for a Per Mertesacker handball but they struggled to create any real chances. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain was fouled by Chris Brunt for Arteta's second and a first Arsenal win in four league games. Lukas Podolski should have put a more convincing gloss on the win only to scuff a late shot horribly high from six yards. For West Brom, it was a third straight top flight-defeat but they will no doubt point to the decisions of referee Mike Jones for playing a part in their downfall. Victory will come as a relief for the Gunners as they battled to a result that moves them up to sixth from 10th in the Premier League. Arsenal were watched by former striker Thierry Henry amid talk he could return to the club on a temporary basis from MLS club New York Red Bulls, but he will have seen a side a shadow of the title-winning ones he spearheaded. The Gunners delivered an early statement of intent when Gervinho slid a shot narrowly wide  but, despite dominating possession, Arsenal lacked the speed of thought and pass to break down a Baggies side waiting for the opportunity to pounce on the counter-attack. The visitors' strategy almost paid off when Brunt bent a shot just wide before referee Jones awarded the home side a penalty after deciding Reid had tripped Cazorla. The aggrieved Albion players argued that there had not been any contact but had to watch on as Arteta, who missed a penalty against Fulham last month, put the spot-kick down the middle to beat keeper Boaz Myhill. The visitors almost let in a second when Gervinho pulled the ball back for a lunging Jack Wilshere to poke an effort wide. Albion again felt hard done by when a cross into the area struck the arm of Gunners centre-back Mertesacker only for Jones to reject their penalty appeals and give a free-kick against them. At the other end, Arsenal were only denied a second when keeper Myhill palmed away a Gervinho shot and the same player should have done better from close range after being found by fellow forward Olivier Giroud's chipped pass. The Gunners needed another spot-kick to give them some breathing space, with Brunt penalised for a foul on Oxlade-Chamberlain. While there was little complaint at the award of the penalty, the Baggies believed Oxlade-Chamberlain should have been penalised for a shove on Goran Popov in the build-up. The Baggies threw on Romelu Lukaku and Markus Rosenborg to join Shane Long in attack and, while the former headed wide, they rarely looked like mounting a comeback as Arsenal earned a much-needed win.  Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger:  "I am sorry if it was not a penalty, but I have spoken to Santi and he said he was touched, lost his balance. Has he made a bit more of it? I don't know. "Overall we played well. We were maybe a bit lucky on the first penalty, but we created chances and kept a clean sheet. "We have shown a great spirit, which many people questioned after our last game, so we did our job very well."  West Brom manager Steve Clarke:  "There was zero contact [for the first penalty], it wasn't even close. I am not sure what the referee saw. "It was a bad decision for us and obviously changed the shape of the afternoon. It could have been a nervous afternoon for Arsenal, at 0-0 they hadn't created too much. "We knew the longer the game went the more pressure would come on Arsenal and then we would have a chance. That decision changed it." He added:  "I don't want a witch hunt on referees, in this country we have fantastic referees and a fantastic group that work hard to make the game the game it is. "We have to try to work as hard as we can with the referees, in this game unfortunately it was the poorest of a really good group."

24.04.2013 23:34:09 Aston Villa remain just two points clear of the Premier League relegation zone after an insipid goalless draw against in-form Stoke. Despite dominating possession, Villa created few chances and Christian Benteke tamely side-footed their best opportunity at Stoke's Asmir Begovic. Stoke, who knew they could move up to sixth with victory, failed to force Villa's Brad Guzan into a single save. Potters defender Ryan Shotton was sent off in injury-time for a second yellow. Scoring has been a problem for both sides this season, with just 26 goals between them in their 30 Premier League games ahead of Saturday's encounter. So it was no surprise that Villa, the division's lowest goalscorers, failed to break down their visitors. Defensive strength has been the bedrock of Stoke's success, with only Manchester City conceding fewer goals than the Potters. However, Villa boss Paul Lambert once again opted to leave Â£24m striker Darren Bent on the bench, with the England international finally appearing midway through the second half for his first appearance since the end of October. Huge cheers greeted Bent's arrival but he barely had a touch as he failed to provide the cutting edge sorely lacked by Villa. Most of the home side's best chances fell to Christian Benteke, who has been leading the line during Bent's absence through injury and Lambert's selection policy. The Belgian met a loose ball in the Potters box with a venomous 12th-minute volley, but was denied by a brave block from Stoke skipper Ryan Shawcross. And he wasted an even better chance less than a minute into the second half. Barry Bannan lofted a diagonal pass into the Stoke box to allow Matthew Lowton to head back across goal to the waiting Benteke. But the 22-year-old failed to connect properly and tamely volleyed straight into the hands of Begovic. Tony Pulis's men were unbeaten in five league matches and would have leapfrogged Stoke and Everton into the top six with their fourth consecutive win. But they failed to muster a single opportunity in an impotent attacking display and the single point means they remain ninth in the table. Tempers threatened to boil over on several occasions at Villa Park, most notably when Villa defender Ciaran Clark charged into Stoke midfielder Glenn Whelan just before half-time to spark a melee between both sets of players. Referee Roger East managed to restore peace without resorting to bookings, but Shotton became the first player to receive a yellow card for chatting back to the official. And 18 minutes later he was sent to the dressing room after an innocuous challenge on Villa substitute Fabian Delph.  Stoke manager Tony Pulis:  "We're pleased with the draw. We played some good football as well, but that's for others to judge. We restricted Villa and Asmir [Begovic] hardly had a save to make. We could have offered more of a threat going forward. "I'm disappointed with [Ryan Shotton's] two bookings when you compare those with the tackle on Glenn Whelan [by Villa's Ciaran Clark]. "But you cannot criticise the referee and say they are doing something different for each side. I'm not going to do that because they [the FA] have took money off me before for doing that. But it was pretty bizarre for me and disappointing."  Aston Villa boss Paul Lambert:  "For 0-0 it was a decent spectacle. We played really well and had early dominance. I couldn't ask for any more other than the goal. "We had a lot of ball and dominated the game possession-wise. The young lads at the back coped well with Stoke's physicality. "Darren Bent did fine. Everybody played their part."

24.04.2013 23:34:09 Jason Puncheon's second-half goal earned Southampton a vital victory against Reading, lifting the Saints out of the bottom three and leaving the Royals second bottom and six points from safety. Saints dominated the match and had chances throughout, but Puncheon's shot, which found the net via the far post, proved decisive. Reading struggled to make any sort of impact on the game with Hal Robson-Kanu's close-range header off the post their best chance. Jay Tabb also had an effort well saved by Saints keeper Kelvin Davis, while Maya Yoshida's flick-on from Puncheon's corner was cleared off the line by Reading defender Shaun Cummings. This fixture last season was a pivotal game in the race for the Championship title, Reading winning that day and going on to top the table ahead of Saints. But despite opening with four defeats, Southampton have made the better start to the Premier League campaign. Their home form has been the basis for that success with two wins and three draws in their last six league games at St Mary's, while Reading headed into the match without an away victory this season. Saints dominated proceedings early on with the movement of their front four causing the visitors' defence problems. Jay Rodriguez and Morgan Schneiderlin both went close for the hosts. Reading keeper Adam Federici was soon called into action, comfortably saving Adam Lallana's half volley and palming away Rickie Lambert's curling effort from the edge of the area at full stretch. At the other end, Tabb had Reading's first chance with his run and shot kept out by Davis, and the midfielder then losing his footing under pressure from Jack Cork when going for the rebound. Saints did have the ball in the net before the break but Puncheon's header was ruled out for an earlier foul by Yoshida on Federici, although replays suggested it was a harsh decision. The hosts then lost Lallana, who was forced off with a knee injury after an innocuous looking challenge from Tabb, although Saints did have the benefit of being able to bring on Â£12m forward Gaston Ramirez. But, on the stroke of half-time, Reading almost took the lead, Robson-Kanu heading against the post from six yards out after Sean Morrison nodded the ball back across goal. Roared on by vociferous home support at St Mary's, Saints started the second half impressively with Puncheon's low strike from the edge of the area well saved by Federici. Royals boss Brian McDermott looked an increasingly frustrated figure on the sidelines as his side struggled to assert themselves and Puncheon duly gave Saints the lead with a fine finish across Federici, which flew in off the post. Jobi McAnuff then curled a shot wide of the angle for Reading, who brought on defender Alex Pearce for the injured Morrison while striker Noel Hunt replaced Tabb. But a tame Adam Le Fondre header that bobbled wide was their only further chance of note as Nigel Adkins's side held on.  Southampton manager Nigel Adkins said:  "I thought we dominated the game and we were worthy winners. The crowd got behind the players, we played with a good tempo and it was a good 1-0 victory. "The goal was excellent and one from the training ground where we get the full-backs forward. "Adam [Lallana] has a knee injury. He has a brace on, as we always do in that situation, and he is on crutches but we will have to assess it in the next 24 hours."  Reading boss Brian McDermott said:  "We're obviously disappointed - we all are after a game like that. We know the league we're in; we've got to keep our heads down, dig in and get on with it. "I feel sorry for our fans. They've come up to Southampton and we haven't got a result. We play for them and they'll be as frustrated as we are. Everyone in the dressing room is bitterly disappointed. "When you don't win you get asked questions and I understand that. I'm as gutted as anyone today. We all do our best every single day. I know what they players are giving us, we pick ourselves up quickly ahead of Tuesday. "We're used to winning, now we're not winning and nobody enjoys that. We'll keep going because things change."

24.04.2013 23:34:09 Fernando Torres scored twice as Chelsea secured a first Premier League win in eight games and ensured Sunderland dropped into the relegation zone. The Blues dominated early on and a classy Torres volley made it 1-0. Sunderland responded but a rash tackle by Sebastian Larsson gifted Torres a second from the penalty spot and Juan Mata drove in a third after the break. Adam Johnson's fine shot gave the hosts hope but Chelsea held on to give Rafael Benitez a first league win as boss. It was the Spaniard's first Premier League victory in four attempts as interim manager but it increases the pressure on counterpart Martin O'Neill, whose side have won only two games in 23 league matches and have slipped to 18th place in the table following Southampton's win over Reading.  A dismal run of form had left a 10-point gap between Chelsea and leaders Manchester United at the start of the day. Benitez had insisted the deficit at the top of the table was not insurmountable.  But with no wins in seven league games and an enforced break because of the World Club Cup in Japan, defeat against a hopelessly out-of-form Black Cats side would surely have ended their title chances. That never looked likely as Chelsea established control from the outset. Eden Hazard appeared unfortunate not to win a penalty when Larsson tugged him back as the Belgian raced through on goal and Mata and Torres both had decent openings. But Torres soon steered the visitors ahead with a beautifully controlled volley from Hazard's cross after a flowing move. Chelsea's rhythm was disrupted when holding midfielder Oriol Romeu was forced off after 20 minutes with what appeared to be a knee injury. And, having been completely outplayed, Sunderland suddenly upped the tempo. They started to press further up the pitch, denying the visitors space in their own half and forcing mistakes. O'Neill's side still struggled to create clear chances, but Stephane Sessegnon tested keeper Petr Cech with a swerving long-range effort and there were a couple of nervy moments in the Blues defence. However, any fears of a repeat of last week's second-half capitulation against West Ham all but disappeared as Chelsea scored either side of the interval. Larsson raced back and needlessly chopped down Ramires on the goal-line in first-half injury-time. And Torres - having scored his first Premier League goal since 6 October - showed renewed confidence to assume spot-kick responsibilities and found the corner with his first penalty in English football. Three minutes after the restart Mata had made it 3-0, calmly shooting into the far corner when after an instinctive first-time Torres strike crashed back off the bar after a Phil Bardsley mis-kick. Victor Moses almost added a fourth soon after but Johnson's breathtaking strike across Cech gave the hosts hope with 25 minutes left. And suddenly Chelsea started to look shaky. David Luiz and Gary Cahill both made important defensive interceptions as Sunderland dominated territory. Johnson forced a fine save from Cech from a 25-yard free-kick, Connor Wickham - who started in place of the injured Steven Fletcher up front - went close with a low shot across goal and Craig Gardner struck the bar with a powerful free-kick. But Sunderland were left to rue their defensive shortcomings and unable to prevent a 15th defeat in 16 games against Chelsea, who head off to Japan in a much better frame of mind after a turbulent few weeks. The Blues, who begin their World Club Cup campaign on Thursday, will also have midfielder Frank Lampard fit and available after his late appearance as a substitute following seven weeks out with a calf injury.

24.04.2013 23:34:09 Norwich extended their unbeaten run in the Premier League to nine games despite a spirited Swansea fightback. A first-half strike from Steven Whittaker and headers from Sebastien Bassong and captain Grant Holt gave the visitors the advantage. Second-half efforts from in-form forward Michu and Jonathan de Guzman put the Canaries under pressure. A left-footed Robert Snodgrass free-kick made it four for the Canaries, before a late Michu consolation. In chilly south Wales conditions the crowd at Liberty Stadium saw two sides brimming with confidence from the off. Michael Laudrup's hosts entered into the fixture undefeated in their last six in the league and fresh from a 2-0 victory at Arsenal. However, the visitors were in even better form - Norwich's eight games without a loss equalled their best run in the top flight back in October 1989. That said, the Canaries had only scored five goals away from home all season before Saturday. Both sides made two changes to their starting XI and Swansea recalled striker Danny Graham, who had scored six in his last four games against Norwich. And it was the former Watford frontman who came closest for the Swans in the first half, a looping header cannoning off keeper Mark Bunn's crossbar after a De Guzman chip sent him clear inside the box. Michu also came close, a deflected shot narrowly wide of Bunn's right-hand post with the keeper wrong footed. In contrast, when Norwich created openings they converted them. First right-back Whittaker surged forward, exchanged passes on the flank with Snodgrass, then cut inside. The Scotland international travelled unchallenged into the Swansea area before unleashing a fierce drive past Gerhard Tremmel at his near post. The Norwich lead was doubled 25 minutes later, Bassong leaping and connecting well with a hanging Grant Holt cross to bury his header home. And it was Holt himself who claimed the third. A foul on the right flank allowed Snodgrass to curl in a free-kick. The Norwich captain eluded marker Ki Sung-Yeung and powered a header past the exposed Tremmel. However, the visitors' three-goal advantage did not last long into the second half, Laudrup's men forcing an early corner after good work by Chico Flores on the right. The corner itself posed little threat, but it was collected out on the left by 19-year-old Wales international Ben Davies. His pass back to the onrushing Michu was inch- perfect, the Spanish striker burying his shot past Bunn. Nine minutes later Swansea had a second and were back in contention. Nathan Dyer beat Javier Garrido on the right, and his ball in was not cleared. It fell to De Guzman on the edge of the area who converted his crisp volley with aplomb. The hosts had the ball in the back of the Norwich net a third time, substitute Itay Shechter converting after Bunn spilled the ball under pressure from Michu. However,  despite the public address system kicking into action, referee Howard Webb had blown for a foul on Bunn and play resumed. The momentum was with Swansea, but the atmosphere was sucked out of Liberty Stadium with 15 minutes remaining. Swans captain Ashley Williams upended Holt 25 yards out and was cautioned. Snodgrass then stepped up and curled a sublime effort over the wall and in. But Laudrup's team continued to chase, and in stoppage time they came close to stealing a point. First De Guzman whipped in a tremendous cross that Michu headed in at the far post for his 13th of the campaign. Then a ball over the top was flicked on by Shechter, forcing Bunn to tip over his crossbar. That proved the final chance in a pulsating game, a result which ended Swansea's six games unbeaten and pushed Norwich up to 11th in the table.  Swansea City manager Michael Laudrup: "In the first half we conceded three goals and it was not a very good performance. But the first half was as bad as the second was good. I think the players bounced back great. We scored two in 15 minutes and had a third one ruled out, which was a little harsh. But I don't think we deserved to win today after that first-half performance."  Chris Hughton, Norwich City boss: "It wasn't easy, even when we got those goals in the first-half. Swansea are a wonderful footballing side, and it's obvious why they've had such a good start. We didn't do ourselves any favours conceding in that second half, but we showed great character to come back at them. I thought it was a fair result today, on the balance of play. We deserved it. Has this been overdue? Perhaps. We've been working hard for it."

24.04.2013 23:34:09 Queens Park Rangers set a new record for the longest winless start to a Premier League season after James McCarthy rescued Wigan. McCarthy fired the Latics ahead following a disputed corner, the Republic of Ireland international's shot deflecting off Jamie Mackie. Ryan Nelsen headed the Hoops level before Djibril Cisse put Harry Redknapp within sight of his first QPR win. But poor defending allowed McCarthy to equalise after Jean Beausejour's pass. Redknapp has drawn all three games since taking charge of the Premier League's bottom club, who are still without a win after 16 games. Swindon Town previously held the longest winless start and went on to be relegated in 1993-94. A hard-earned point at Wigan is no mean feat particularly as West Ham United and Reading have both suffered defeat at the DW Stadium this season. But Redknapp will have targeted three points from this game and knows time is against him, QPR are now eight points from safety with 22 games remaining. Wigan could not have wished for a better start, McCarthy opening the scoring in the 19th minute moments after David Jones's clever free-kick from 20 yards had been tipped over by Robert Green. Republic of Ireland international McCarthy had not found the net since February 2011. But the midfielder's beautifully struck first-time shot from just inside the area, after QPR had failed to deal with a disputed corner by Beausejour, gave Green no chance after taking a slight deflection off Mackie. The visitors argued that the corner should not have been awarded, claiming that the ball came off a Latics player. But their mood quickly changed when another corner led to Nelsen rewarding the hundreds of fans who made the long trek from London with a 26th-minute equaliser. Roberto Martinez was without four defenders due to injury and suspension, but the Wigan manager will have been upset that Nelsen was allowed to head the ball beyond Ali Al Habsi after shrugging off his marker Adrian Lopez. Quality was at a premium in a match played out in miserable conditions, Franco Di Santo's miss after Clint Hill's first-half mistake typical in what was an error-strewn contest. Green produced fine saves to deny the busy McCarthy, Jones and Jordi Gomez before the latter struck the underside of the bar during a sustained spell of second-half Wigan pressure. But the visitors took the lead against the run of play when substitute Cisse fired his side ahead 13 minutes after coming on. The former Liverpool player produced a fine 71st minute finish after Lopez's error allowed Shaun Wright-Phillips to craft an opening for Cisse. But QPR's lead lasted less than three minutes, McCarthy firing through a sea of legs following Beausejour's delivery to deny Redknapp victory and QPR a first away win since November 2011.

24.04.2013 23:34:10 Demba Ba struck twice as Newcastle ended a run of four straight defeats with victory over 10-man Wigan. Latics defender Maynor Figueroa was sent off in the 12th minute after he brought down Papiss Cisse in the box. Ba smashed home the penalty and added a second eight minutes later when he pounced on an Ali Al-Habsi spill. Wigan tried to fight their way back into the game but Gael Bigirimana wrapped up the win with a spectacular third in the 71st minute. Roberto Martinez's side have now lost four of their last five games and are just two points above the relegation zone. The visitors had started the game brightly and tried to put a nervy Newcastle under pressure with a couple of early snapshots, although they failed to trouble home keeper Tim Krul. But home anxieties were eased in the 12th minute when Cisse was forced off the ball by Figueroa as he darted onto a clever pass from strike partner Ba, and referee Mike Jones immediately pointed to the spot before producing a red card. Ba tucked the penalty beyond Al-Habsi and, before 10-man Wigan had properly reorganised, he then added a second. Full-back Davide Santon cut inside and hit a fierce 25-yard strike, which Al-Habsi could only parry straight to the feet of Ba, who tapped the ball into the empty net. Roberto Martinez reacted by replacing attacking midfielder Jordi Gomez with James McArthur in an attempt to stem the home attacks. And the change worked as his side's slick passing had Newcastle on the back foot for long periods, despite their one-man advantage. But the Latics still failed to seriously threaten the Newcastle goal, Al-Habsi remaining the busier keeper. He reacted well to keep out Marveaux's 52nd-minute strike and a low effort from Bigirimana but he had no chance when the latter hit a brilliant third - his first ever goal in professional football. The former Coventry midfielder cut inside to curl a dipping left-foot shot past inside the far post. Ba missed the chance to complete his hat-trick, slicing his shot from close range, before limping out of the game late - the only negative on a night of huge relief for Newcastle manager Alan Pardew.  Newcastle manager Alan Pardew: "It's been difficult for the players and staff and it was nice to get a break tonight, and it was a break - we got one tonight. "I think it was a penalty. When the defender is coming across the striker and he's got a goal chance the referee has got a tough decision. I think it was a penalty and that gave us a great start to the game." "Demba loves it here. It's a football city, we've tried to take the clause [Â£7.5m get-out in his contract] out but we haven't been successful with that and that is difficult for us and Demba."

24.04.2013 23:34:10 Everton scored either side of half-time to maintain their European challenge and push Queens Park Rangers closer to relegation from the Premier League. The visitors were in the ascendancy when Loic Remy's shot was saved by Tim Howard after Junior Hoilett's early curler fizzed just wide. But five minutes before the break, Darron Gibson's shot was cruelly deflected off Clint Hill on its way in. And, after Everton improved, Victor Anichebe flicked in following a corner. For periods in the first half it looked as though QPR might continue their three-game unbeaten run against the Toffees since their return to the top flight in May 2011. But the manner in which they went behind understandably stripped them of confidence and their position looks ever more parlous with only five games remaining. Harry Redknapp's side remain seven points from safety, but they have now played two more games than their closest relegation rivals Wigan and one more than Sunderland, who face Newcastle on Sunday. With Rangers having won only four league games all season, Redknapp targeted as many victories again from their final six games, but the prospect of survival must now look even more remote. Following Arsenal's win over Norwich, David Moyes's Everton stay sixth in the table and face a crucial game against the Gunners on Tuesday. They are still in the hunt for a Champions League spot, as they sit just three points below fourth-placed Chelsea, who have a game in hand. Everton recorded their fourth consecutive home win but it was QPR who twice came close to permeating the home defence before Gibson's fortunate opener. When Park Ji-sung laid the ball off to Hoilett, the Canadian's curling shot was a whisker wide before Remy's fierce drive was palmed away by Howard. The hosts were frustrated by what they thought was some rough-house QPR defending, and with Steven Pienaar back in the side their only real threat came when the South African combined with Leighton Baines down Everton's left. Despite Sylvain Distin's off-target effort, QPR withstood Everton's laboured forays and were unlucky to concede the opening goal. Baines crossed low for Kevin Mirallas and, when the Belgian's effort came back to Gibson, his shot cannoned in off the luckless Hill for the Irishman's second Everton goal. Coming six days after his side conceded a crucial injury-time equaliser against Wigan, Redknapp looked absolutely sick on the sidelines and with some justification. Problems then mounted for his side as Everton emerged after the break as a completely different proposition. They were far quicker to the ball and passed with extra vitality as they conjured a number of chances, putting QPR under pressure from a succession of corners. Mirallas tricked his way past Nedum Onuoha and crossed low to Anichebe but the Nigerian smacked his shot against the post from eight yards. He made up for that miss, though, when he flicked in Distin's header from another accurate Baines corner. It was no more than Everton deserved and they could have made the scoreline more comfortable when Mirallas twice had shots saved by Julio Cesar. Onuoha had a solitary effort for QPR as the game petered out miserably for them. With few chances to make amends now, their season could go the same way.  Everton boss David Moyes on Darron Gibson's goal:  "He should do more but he has a thigh problem and we were nearly having to take him off. We think he will need an operation at end of the season so he has been reticent to shoot and take things on but it got a big deflection which helped us as well. "It's a really important three points, I was worried about today's game. QPR have a lot to play for but they are nearly getting to a situation where there's not much to play for. "I think if we beat Arsenal in midweek we can talk about the Champions League but if we lose we are more talking about trying, if possible, to finish in that Europa League place."  QPR manager Harry Redknapp:  "It was another blow, last week was a massive blow at home to Wigan. Everton is always a difficult place to come but at half-time I thought we were unfortunate to be 1-0 down. "The goal was a massive deflection and we came in at half-time feeling sorry for ourselves. "You have to keep going, you can't suddenly feel sorry for ourselvesâ¦ but we started sloppy and became undisciplined, we didn't do our jobs properly, we gave free-kicks away, we kicked the ball away, we got bookings. It didn't do us any favours. "I can't stand there and go no [we can't survive], if it's a no I may as well go on holiday now. "We have to believe, we have to beat Stoke, we have to go to Reading and win, we have to win the other two home games against Newcastle and Arsenal. I know it's tough and it's going to be very difficult but while you've got a chance you have to keep going."

24.04.2013 23:34:10 The pressure increased on Sunderland manager Martin O'Neill as his side were left a point above the Premier League drop zone following defeat at Norwich. The Canaries went two up when Sebastien Bassong forced in a shot and Anthony Pilkington scored with a low strike. Craig Gardner pulled one back but the visitors then wasted a chance to level. Gardner's free-kick hit the post and the ball fell to Matt Kilgallon, who shot over the bar from 10 yards out with an empty net in front of him. Another Gardner shot was cleared off the goal-line by defender Javier Garrido and Canaries keeper Mark Bunn denied Stephane Sessegnon and Danny Rose as the home side held on for the win. This was a fourth successive home victory for Norwich, following wins against Arsenal, Stoke and Manchester United, and their unbeaten run in the league now stands at eight games. While Sunderland's defeat leaves them precariously placed, O'Neill will take heart from an improved second-half display ahead of testing fixtures against Chelsea, Manchester City and Manchester United. But the Black Cats boss will not want a repeat of the grim form they showed during the first half and which ultimately left a side with just two wins from 22 Premier League games with too much to do at Carrow Road. It was little surprise when the visitors began with the lack of confidence and self-belief their poor form suggested, and Norwich were quick to capitalise. Robert Snodgrass curled in a free-kick which was inadvertently flicked on by the arm of Sunderland defender Carlos Cuellar before Bassong arrived at the far post to score from close range. And, when Pilkington latched on to a Bradley Johnson pass to surge forward, cut inside Cuellar and drive in a low shot past keeper Simon Mignolet, O'Neill must have feared the worst. Sunderland rarely looked like scoring, although they did get on the scoreboard when Gardner curled a low 18-yard shot past Bunn on the stroke of half-time. The visitors came out rejuvenated after the break, with Connor Wickham replacing injured striker Steve Fletcher. Cuellar mistimed an attempted shot from Sebastian Larsson's corner when well-placed before Kilgallon's glaring miss. Pilkington had a shot palmed away by Mignolet at the other end but Norwich were on the back foot for most of the second half. Some last-ditch defending helped keep Sunderland at bay though, while keeper Bunn also played his part as he saved strikes from Sessegnon and Rose.  Norwich manager Chris Hughton:  "I thought we were excellent in the first half and it is difficult to sustain that over 90 minutes, particularly with it being the third game in a week. "We haven't made any changes to the team so to sustain that for 90 minutes is tough and of course their goal gave them the lift they needed. "It was a real tough shift in that second half so testament to the players, there were saves that needed to be made and bodies that needed to be in front of some balls and they did that."

24.04.2013 23:34:10 Manchester United remain top of the Premier League after beating Reading in a remarkable seven-goal thriller. United fell behind when Hal Robson-Kanu lashed in but hit back via Anderson's finish and a Wayne Rooney penalty. The Royals reclaimed the lead when Adam Le Fondre and Sean Morrison both headed in from corners. The visitors swung the game their way through neat finishes from Rooney and Robin van Persie, who also had a shot that crossed the line not given. United came into the game knowing a point would be enough to return them to the top of the Premier League table. Ferguson's men had been boosted by the results of Saturday's earlier games. Manchester City only drew 1-1 at home against Everton, while Chelsea were beaten 3-1 at West Ham.  That the Red Devils extended their lead over their title rivals tells only half the story of a phenomenal game of football. The Madejski Stadium has already hosted its share of see-saw goalfests this season and provides more questions than answers about the overall quality of this United side. The first half alone was an epic, showcasing seven legitimate goals, another wrongly adjudged not to have crossed the line, appalling defending that warranted a pre-half time tactical substitution and the kind of end-to-end football used to justify the Premier League's unofficial reputation as the best league in the world. Reading may not be taking any points but they deserve their share of the plaudits for a committed contribution to a game from which any reward would have been a bonus in their quest to extend their top-flight stay to a second season. The most notable examples of defensive frailty came from the title challengers, who fell behind to the first goal for the 14th time this season - when Jonny Evans's poor clearing header allowed Robson-Kanu time and space to lash in from close range - and then conspired to fall behind again midway through the half when identical Nicky Shorey corners were headed home in the box by Le Fondre and Morrison respectively. Full-back Rafael was taken out of the action to be replaced by Chris Smalling, but in truth any one of the back five could have suffered the Brazilian's fate. That United were not facing an uphill battle of the sort that endured Arsenal in the Capital One Cup owes purely to their potency at the other end of the field, where they retain the ability to carve teams open seemingly at will. A slick one-two between Anderson and Ashley Young and a superb near-post finish from the Brazilian, followed by a calmly-converted penalty from Rooney   after Jonny Evans was bundled over by Jay Tabb, overturned the Royals' first goal. And Rooney's neat side-footed goal from a Patrice Evra cross, just before Van Persie's own tidy finish following a flick from his strike-partner, ensured they led at the break. United should have had a fifth as well prior to the 45th minute when Van Persie's shot from close range crossed the line before being cleared by Shaun Cummings, but the officials ruled otherwise. After a first half like that, the second was always likely to be a relative disappointment and so it proved with far fewer chances. Van Persie spurned the best of them when he nipped in to capitalise on a poor piece of control by home keeper Adam Federici but after buying himself a yard to shoot the Dutchman unbelievably put his effort over the bar. The miss ensured anxious closing stages for United but they demonstrated a resolve they had so sorely lacked earlier in the game to repel Reading's increasingly desperate attacks. With Chelsea and West Brom both losing on Saturday it means the gap between second and third is now seven points, doing little to quash suggestions that this season is already shaping into a two-horse race between United and City. Ferguson's side have their noses in front but the flaws inherent in their display at the Madejski means they have a lot of work to do before they can consider themselves favourites.  Reading manager Brian McDermott: "It was a fantastic effort and quality as well. I'm so proud of our players today. "We know what our agenda is for this season. There is no problem with confidence from our players. "I think we are becoming people's second team in the Premier League. We want our results to match our performance and hopefully that will come. Hopefully it is good to watch for our fans."

24.04.2013 23:34:10 Arsenal's worst start to a season under Arsene Wenger continued as Michu scored two late goals to leave Arsenal 10th in the Premier League table. Spanish striker Michu struck with two minutes left, curling the ball home after a neat one-two with Luke Moore. Nathan Dyer's persistence then sent Michu clear and another composed finish gave Wojciech Szczesny no hope. Gervinho wasted Arsenal's best chance when he made a mess of a free header in front of goal. The midweek draw at Everton had already given Arsene Wenger his lowest points tally at this stage of the season - 21 points from 14 games - since taking over at Arsenal 16 years ago. The groans of discontent were loud and clear as his players trudged off after another toothless display that leaves them five points behind fourth-placed rivals Tottenham. Arsenal improved considerably after a poor first half as they starved Swansea of possession, but Michu's double strike as the game began to peter out gave them no chance to recover. His controlled left-footed finishes took his tally to 11 for the season, further emphasising the bargain price of Â£2m Swansea paid to take him from Rayo Vallecano in the summer. Wenger had targeted this game - the first of four at home from the next six - as a springboard to climb up the table and back into the title race. But those hopes now lie in tatters and it will be Swansea who will be looking upwards as they move to within three points of the top four. There were early warning signs for Arsenal as the visitors began playing with a confidence borne from manager Michael Laudrup's instruction to express themselves without the constraints of pressure. Sharp, intricate passing released full-back Angel Rangel behind the static Arsenal back four, but Szczesny was alert to save his first effort and then block the second shot on the rebound. The Gunners were then indebted to a last-ditch lunge from Thomas Vermaelen to deny Dyer, whose hesitation after running free from the halfway line gave the Arsenal captain a chance to recover. Despite a lack of invention, pace and fluidity, Arsenal could easily have scored twice before half-time through Gervinho. The striker was inches away from connecting with an inviting cross from Carl Jenkinson, but then got it all wrong when left unmarked six yards out. So poor was Gervinho's attempt that Theo Walcott retrieved the ball before it went out for a throw-in. The Gunners finally showed some urgency and appetite after the break, quickly forcing Gerhard Tremmel into a first save when Santi Cazorla delivered a low drive. Two half-hearted penalty claims were then waved away before Szczesny continued his personal duel with Rangel to deny him with another fine save. Gervinho's ineffectual afternoon ended just after the hour mark, and his replacement, Olivier Giroud, gave referee Mark Clattenburg a tight call to make almost immediately. Giroud was brought down by a desperate Chico Flores lunge on the edge of the area, but Clattenburg saw the faintest of touches from the Swansea defender. Arsenal continued to probe, and Swansea were fortunate that Vermaelen's far-post header went straight at Tremmel. But having offered little after the break, the Swans struck with ruthless efficiency to snatch all three points. A simple one-two was enough split the home defence to release Michu for the first, and his lifted side-foot finish beat the out-stretched hand of Szczesny. Another incisive finish followed two minutes later after Jenkinson's attempted backpass was deflected into his path by the tenacious Dyer, leaving Swansea to celebrate only their second away win over the Gunners.  Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger: "We are in this job to turn things around, and I am confident we will [because of] the quality of the players and the spirit we have in the team. "It is a good moment to stick together. "I am not so much worried about [league] places, even if that is not the place you want to be, but I believe what is important is we get the quality of our game back. Then the places change."  Swansea City manager Michael Laudrup: "There have been three great performances, each better than the [previous] one. "The team is playing with a lot of confidence. They [Arsenal] put us under pressure for 20 minutes in the second half and you know their players can make the difference at any moment, so you can never sit easy. "We looked in quite good shape and were only defending deep a few times."

24.04.2013 23:34:10 Jermain Defoe struck twice against Fulham to help Tottenham to a third straight Premier League victory. Fulham keeper Mark Schwarzer was at fault as Sandro opened the scoring from 30 yards following a goalless first half, before Defoe struck from close range to make it 2-0 soon after. The hosts struggled to respond and Defoe added a third after a pass by former Cottagers player Clint Dempsey. Tottenham's Gareth Bale was booked for diving for the second straight game. Defoe, 30, showed he is a striker in form, his second goal a well-executed low effort to confirm he is one of the best finishers in the Premier League. The England international - capped 52 times by his country - has 14 goals in all competitions this season. In total, he has 128 goals for Tottenham, five behind Alan Gilzean, who is the club's seventh all-time leading scorer But victory came at a cost for Tottenham, who recorded a rare clean sheet in the league. Defender Michael Dawson went off injured and had to be replaced in the first half, while in-form Bale also failed to finish the match after appearing to suffer a hamstring problem. It turned out to be an eventful afternoon for Bale, who was booked for the seventh time this season. Referee Chris Foy had no hesitation in cautioning the Wales international in the 24th minute for diving after a challenge with Steve Sidwell. Yet Bale had cause to feel aggrieved by Foy's decision as he appeared to be fouled by Fulham's former Aston Villa midfielder. This was very much a case of friends reunited on the banks of the River Thames - Tottenham's Dempsey and Mousa Dembele lining up against their old club while Fulham, managed by former Spurs manager Martin Jol, had ex-Tottenham striker Dimitar Berbatov in attack. Berbatov rarely threatened as Tottenham picked off the hosts after a goalless first half. Sandro broke the deadlock in the 55th minute with a low, long-range attempt that Schwarzer will feel he should have kept out. There were concerned looks from the Tottenham bench when Bale hobbled off but Defoe struck twice in five minutes to cement the points. His first goal came after intelligent play by Bale's replacement Gylfi Sigurdsson in the 72nd minute while his second, after Dempsey's excellent threaded pass, was a quality low finish from 12 yards out. Fulham had their chances - none more so than when Mladen Petric was denied by Hugo Lloris from close range following John Arne Riise's early low cross. But Jol can have few complaints about the outcome against his former club.

24.04.2013 23:34:10 Liverpool centre-back Daniel Agger earned his side's third home league win of the season to leave Southampton embedded in the bottom three. The Reds had the better of the chances and a Jonjo Shelvey strike hit the post, while a Luis Suarez free-kick came back off the crossbar. Agger finally rewarded his side's play when he headed in Glen Johnson's cross. Southampton's main threat came from Rickie Lambert and he went close with two speculative long-range efforts. Although the scoreline suggested a slender win, it was a convincing victory for a Liverpool side which had most of the play only to leave themselves vulnerably placed by not adding to their lead. However, Southampton rarely looked like breaking through the Reds' rearguard as the attack-minded quartet of Lambert, Gaston Ramirez, Adam Lallana and Jason Puncheon struggled to make their presence felt. The defeat checked the recent improvement of the Saints as their unbeaten four-game streak came to an end. Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers will point to back-to-back league wins at Anfield for the first time since September 2011 as further signs of the progress his team are making. Having seen Southampton striker Lambert fire a 25-yard shot wide, Johnson sliced a near-post shot across the face of the goal from a Suarez cut back. Johnson's energy and enterprise on the right flank was a constant source of threat and the defender also had a left-foot shot saved after cutting inside. Liverpool midfielder Steven Gerrard has come in for    after scoring just once in the league so far this season but, while he may not be as clinical in front of goal as in previous seasons, he is still intrinsic to his side's game. His prompting of the play and range of passing can still hurt the opposition and Gerrard went close when a goal-bound 15-yard shot was cleared by Morgan Schneiderlin. Gerrard set up fellow midfielder Shelvey for a powerful shot but the 20-year-old saw his effort come crashing back off a shuddering post as the home side's frustrations continued to mount. Suarez thought he might be in on goal after Saints centre-back Jose Fonte failed to deal with goalkeeper Pepe Reina's long ball forward but visiting keeper Paulo Gazzaniga got a vital touch before the ball was put out for a corner. Suarez bent a free-kick against the crossbar and, while he was ruing the home side again being denied, Johnson crossed for Agger to head the Reds deservedly in front. Apart from Lambert's half-volley from 40 yards, which forced Reina into a smart save, Southampton failed to exert any real goal threat, with the returning midfielder Lucas Leiva giving Liverpool more protection. Jose Enrique, back to playing in his more accustomed left-back position, poked a shot wide and a powerful drive saved by Gazzaniga. Suarez also put a shot wide when well-placed and Liverpool's ability to play without him will be tested in their next game against West Ham when he will be suspended after picking up his fifth yellow card.  Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers:  "The game should have been put to bed well before it was. "No matter how much you dominate the game, if it's still only 1-0 going into the final 10 minutes it can always offer you a bit of a challenge where you have to defend. "There's no question we should have been out of sight, but the most important thing is it was a terrific performance and another win at Anfield. We continue with another three points and moving up the league."  Southampton boss Nigel Adkins: "We have come away from home in a good run of form of late but Liverpool's movement was very good and we couldn't get a grip of the football. "If we could have got to half-time at 0-0 that would have been pleasing but a free header in the penalty area has given them a 1-0 lead. "Credit to the players because we managed to hang in there and the last 10-15 minutes we went a lot more direct."

24.04.2013 23:34:10 Manchester City continued their unbeaten start to the Premier League season but had to settle for a point against a battling Everton side. Everton scored when Marouane Fellaini turned in Leighton Baines's cross after Joe Hart saved his initial header. Carlos Tevez levelled from the spot after Fellaini dragged down Edin Dzeko. City had the better of a tight second half but struggled to create chances and Everton almost snatched victory with Nikica Jelavic's free-kick. The draw was enough to send Roberto Mancini's side to the top of the table on goal difference, at least until Manchester United play Reading in Saturday's late game. It will still be viewed as two points dropped in the title race, especially as City had won 29 of their last 31 home league games ahead of the visit of the Toffees. But David Moyes' fine record against Mancini, who has now only won only one of seven meetings with Everton, always suggested things would not be straightforward for the champions. Both sides began cautiously, with the game getting bogged down in a midfield battle until Everton took the lead just after the half hour mark. Vincent Kompany could only flick on a whipped Leighton Baines cross and, although Hart kept out Fellaini's initial header with a fine reflex save, he was helpless to stop the Belgian bundling the rebound in with his thigh. City responded by fashioning their first real chances of the game, with Tim Howard clawing away a Tevez header and then turning Dzeko's snap-shot around his post. The corner that followed saw Fellaini concede the controversial penalty that led to City's equaliser, with Dzeko going to ground after having his shirt tugged by the Belgian. Referee Lee Probert pointed to the spot and Tevez stepped up to fire down the centre of the goal. Everton still ended the half on the attack, with Fellaini forcing a sprawling save from Hart just before the interval, but the Toffees were firmly on the backfoot afterwards. Only frustration was to follow for City, however. They dominated possession but could find no way through Everton's determined defence and their only effort on goal saw Howard push away Maicon's swerving shot. The home fans could not understand Mancini's decision to replace the hard-working Tevez with Sergio Aguero as he juggled his attack. In truth, the Argentine's introduction, as well as that of Mario Balotelli, had little impact - Everton were just too well organised at the back. A difficult afternoon for City could have been worse - Hart had to readjust when Jelavic's free-kick bounced in front of him, and he only just managed to push the ball around his post. But a draw - Everton's seventh in their last nine games - was probably the fairest result.  Manchester City boss Roberto Mancini: "Everton is always a difficult game because they work hard, they defend very well. "In the second half we played better, probably deserved to score another goal. "In the end we are not happy but the season is long and this doesn't change anything. "If you don't pay attention you can lose three points and it is sometimes better to take one."  Everton manager David Moyes on Manchester City's equaliser: "It is not a penalty kick. "You can't be giving ones like that. There'd be a penalty every time there's a corner kick. "The fourth official told me that it was given for a foul by Leon Osman, so I've got my doubts if the referee saw the incident. But even if it was Fellaini, it's not a penalty kick, nowhere near. "They say it levels itself out. We'll see."

24.04.2013 23:34:10 Queens Park Rangers are still searching for that elusive first Premier League win of the season as new manager Harry Redknapp's first home game in charge ended in a draw with Aston Villa. Brett Holman fired Villa into an early lead from 20 yards - but Jamie Mackie headed QPR level before the interval and they created the better opportunities to finally secure three points. Shaun Wright-Phillips hit the post and was denied when clean through by Villa keeper Brad Guzan, who also saved well from Ryan Nelsen and Samba Diakite. Clint Hill also struck the woodwork with a second-half header. Redknapp will draw encouragement from the creation of those chances but sooner or later QPR must start to collect victories. Villa boss Paul Lambert selected Darren Bent as a substitute after he was excluded completely for the win against Reading, but the England striker remained unused. Redknapp was given a predictably warm reception when he was introduced to QPR's fans - but the cheers were soon silenced as Villa took the lead. Holman was given far too much time and space to try his luck from 25 yards and he was rewarded as Robert Green - retained in goal after deputising for Julio Cesar when he was injured during the draw at Sunderland - made good contact with the shot but could not keep it out. It was a worrying moment for Redknapp but QPR finally found some rhythm and were level after 18 minutes when Mackie showed excellent movement in the area to send a fine header beyond Guzan from Diakite's cross. Wright-Phillips, recalled by Redknapp, twice had opportunities to justify his manager's faith but could not produce the second goal. He was blocked by Guzan when he raced clear, then struck the base of the post with the American keeper beaten. QPR were forced into a change before the interval when Stephane Mbia was left lying motionless after an accidental collision with Gabriel Agbonlahor. He was treated for several minutes before being taken off on a stretcher and replaced by Shaun Derry. Redknapp made a switch at half-time, sending on Park Ji-sung for Esteban Granero as QPR went in search of victory. Guzan came to Villa's rescue again as the home side maintained the momentum, leaping to his left to claw away Nelsen's shot then saving low from Diakite. Park then had the best chance of all as he broke free in the area but his finish was at a comfortable height for Guzan, who was once again equal to the task. QPR had posed all the attacking questions and were unlucky again as time ran out, with Hill rattling the bar with a header.  QPR manager Harry Redknapp: "We played well, and after a difficult start we came back and dominated the game, we had all the chances and deserved to win the game. We just couldn't get the second goal. "We are in a difficult position but you've got to keep going believing, working hard, we need that first win to get us going. We needed it today but it didn't come and we need to try hard to get it next week against Wigan."

24.04.2013 23:34:10 Dean Whitehead's second-half strike earned Stoke their first Premier League away win of the season and ensured West Brom wasted the chance to go third. The Potters frustrated their hosts with an impressive defensive display in an uneventful and uninspiring game. Neither side created clear chances but Stoke were happy to soak up pressure. And Whitehead steered the winner in from fellow substitute Michael Kightly's cross after great perseverance by Kenwyne Jones. Jones did brilliantly to pressurise Jonas Olsson on the right flank and Whitehead was able to profit to give Stoke a first win on the road in the top flight since they beat Blackburn Rovers last January.  Their fourth victory from five games sees them move up to ninth in the Premier League table, while the Baggies slipped to back-to-back league defeats for only the second time this term. West Brom manager Steve Clarke had insisted there was no need to be concerned by the subdued display in the midweek defeat against Swansea.  And although they had the majority of possession and territory - particularly after the interval - they barely created a chance. Stoke had the second best defensive record in the Premier League prior to their trip to the Hawthorns and it was easy to see why after a thoroughly disciplined first-half display. The Baggies went into the game having won six out of their seven home league encounters, but despite having the ever-impressive striker Shane Long back in the starting line-up, they created almost nothing before the interval. An audacious quick Steven Reid free-kick from the half-way line was the closest they came but Potters keeper Asmir Begovic was alert to the danger and able to tip the ball over. Apart from Reid's clever effort, and a couple of threatening moments after good work by Youssouf Mulumbu and Graham Dorrans, the Baggies were unable to break down a stubborn Stoke defence brilliantly organised by Ryan Shawcross and Robert Huth. It was the visitors who had the best opportunity of the first half but Jones, making his first league start of the season in place of the injured Peter Crouch, was unlucky to see his fine header drift just wide from Charlie Adam's floated cross. Stoke continued to defend deep after the interval and seemed happy to allow West Brom to have the bulk of play and territory and deny the pacy Long space in behind. And the tactics worked brilliantly, as did Tony Pulis's decision to bring on Whitehead and Kightly. Jones chased a long ball and, after Jonas Olsson wasted two opportunities to clear his lines, Kightly was able to knock the ball across to Whitehead who finished from six yards. The Baggies had already brought on both Peter Odemwingie and Romelu Lukaku as they looked for a winner, but Stoke stood firm in the final 15 minutes. Their only chance saw a decent Dorrans strike comfortably palmed away by Begovic as the Potters were able to hold on for a seventh clean sheet of the season with relative ease.  West Brom manager Steve Clarke:  "It wasn't a game of many chances and was the game I expected. The two teams cancelled each other out and it cannot have been great to watch. "They are organised all the time. They are hard to break down and chasing a goal against them is really difficult. It was a little bit frustrating but I can't fault the players. The effort was great. "We made some changes as we had two very difficult trips. I have a good squad and there are players that deserve to play and players that are tired. It was the right time to freshen things up. "We haven't been carried away in the dressing room. We knew there would be bad moments in the season and two defeats in a row are as bad as it has got so far. "I have no doubts about the players' character. The first target is still 40 points and we look forward to the next game."  Stoke City boss Tony Pulis:  "It was a great result because we haven't won away from home this season. We have drawn four away but could easily have won a couple of those. Every one of the players who played gave it everything. "West Brom are a good side and very good at counter-attacking - as good a team at that as I have seen this season. We didn't want to get too stretched or over-exposed. We were quite happy to let them have the ball and try to counter-attack. We wanted to make sure they didn't get behind us. "We didn't want to lose the ball in bad areas. They play between the lines very well. We are delighted to get a clean sheet and win the game. "We have done well defensively, but we have done well all season. It has been a very good week but we don't get too carried away when we are winning or too despondent when we are losing."

24.04.2013 23:34:10 Rafael Benitez's troubled start to life at Chelsea plumbed new depths at Upton Park, as West Ham produced an incredible second-half comeback to snatch a memorable victory. Chants of "sacked in the morning" and "one Di Matteo" rang out as Chelsea allowed a 1-0 half-time lead to slip, with West Ham roaring back thanks to goals from Carlton Cole, Mohamed Diame and Modibo Maiga. Juan Mata fired Chelsea in front early in the first half and the visitors might have increased their advantage before the interval, only to see a series of good chances go to waste. Carlton Cole headed West Ham level, before Diame fired in with a ferocious low shot. With time running out West Ham broke again, allowing Maiga to turn in a rebound. To make matters worse, 26 points from 15 matches represents Chelsea's worst Premier League start in the Abramovich era. It is the first time since February 1995 that Chelsea have failed to win for seven league matches and Benitez becomes the first manager since Gianluca Vialli to not win any of his opening three matches as manager. Much of the focus after this game will fall on Benitez and Chelsea but West Ham were an unrecognisable team after the interval, with the introduction of Diame crucial in changing the game. Chelsea will struggle to know how they let this one slip. Sharper to the ball and swifter to use it, they bossed the early stages, although it took until the 13th minute for them to construct their first meaningful attack. Victor Moses gathered the ball wide on the right and, seeing Torres angling his run behind the West Ham backline, found his team-mate with a cleverly weighted pass. In one fluid movement, the struggling striker cut the ball back across goal where Mata stroked it beyond goalkeeper Jussi Jaaskelainen. The move was a study in simplicity. Chelsea's attacking play was creative, clever and, at times, rapier sharp. The West Ham defence was shredded time and again, as Torres, Moses and Mata were each presented chances that they contrived to waste. And yet, the hosts clung on. Mark Noble fought for everything in the engine room, Matt Jarvis turned and twisted and Kevin Nolan provided the spark in attack. As half-time approached Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech was booked for punching outside his area. James Collins's resulting free-kick deflected up, allowing James Tomkins to head on to Nolan, whose powerful header was tipped over. The introduction of Diame gave West Ham another dimension. The confidence and swagger which had accompanied Chelsea's play in the first half deserted them as the contest turned into an altogether more muscular affair. Where West Ham had stood off and allowed Chelsea to dictate, now they snapped in and fought for everything. Carlton Cole had wasted two earlier chances but when Jarvis's cross deflected up off Gary Cahill, he reacted before Ivanovic, to stoop low and head firmly beyond Cech at the near post. Jarvis tested Cech moments later. Chelsea were being forced back time and again but their attacking threat remained nonetheless. Eden Hazard forced Jaaskelainen to turn his fierce low shot away, only for Torres to prod the rebound straight back at the West Ham goalkeeper. Moments later, Mata clattered Jaaskelainen's left-hand post with a delightful 25-yard free-kick. West Ham were at it too, however, as first Jarvis raced clear only to see his shot brilliantly saved by Cech before Ashley Cole cleared Winston Reid's header off the line. But West Ham would not be denied. Carlton Cole's clever pass found Diame on the edge of the box and his shot flashed beyond Cech and into the net. Chelsea were all over the place and when Matthew Taylor's shot was deflected back to Maiga, the West Ham forward made no mistake to complete an incredible comeback.

24.04.2013 23:34:10 Robin van Persie scored the fastest Premier League goal this season as Manchester United beat West Ham to remain top of the table. The Dutchman struck his 12th goal in all competitions with an effort that deflected in after just 32 seconds. Andy Carroll volleyed off target as the visitors tried to respond, while goalkeeper Jussi Jaaskelainen denied Javier Hernandez and Wayne Rooney. Carlton Cole and Modibo Maiga went close, but the hosts held out. The result maintains Manchester United's one-point advantage over Manchester City and takes them seven points clear of Chelsea and West Brom in third and fourth. West Ham, meanwhile, drop to 10th and the season does not get any easier, with December featuring matches against Chelsea, Liverpool, West Brom, Everton, Arsenal and Reading. While the Hammers arrived as firm underdogs, they could take heart from an impressive start to life back in the top flight. They may also have been pleased to learn that the last promoted club to leave Old Trafford with a league victory - Bolton in 2001 - were managed by Sam Allardyce, with Kevin Nolan on the scoresheet. But Allardyce and Nolan knew their current side faced a daunting assignment against a team who had won six of their previous seven top-flight games and each of their past seven against West Ham. Indeed, West Ham's task became far tougher when Van Persie opened the scoring with some spectators still taking their seats. Michael Carrick found his team-mate on the edge of the box and the striker lifted the ball over Winston Reid before beating Jaaskelainen with the help of a heavy deflection off James Collins. Given that Manchester United had conceded the first goal in nine of their 13 league matches coming into this one, Van Persie's opener should have helped to settle any early nerves. However, a line-up including five changes from the weekend failed to maintain the momentum and that gave West Ham confidence. Despite making four alterations of their own, the Hammers worked hard to restore parity and after Nolan put Matt Taylor's free-kick into the side-netting Carroll fired narrowly over the bar. They lacked a cutting edge up front, though, and Jaaskelainen made a fine low save from Hernandez to keep West Ham within touching distance of their opponents going into the break. West Ham made a positive start to the second half but, again, struggled to mount a sustained challenge. The hosts responded by pushing forward themselves and Jaaskelainen tipped Rooney's curling strike round the post before repelling a Carrick header from Van Persie's corner. Allardyce replaced Carroll with Cole and the substitute made an immediate impact - setting up Matt Taylor for a chance that was wasted and drawing a crucial close-range stop from Anders Lindegaard. As the crowd grew restless another replacement, Maiga, hit an angled drive over the bar, but West Ham could not force an equaliser.

24.04.2013 23:34:10 Luis Suarez headed a dramatic late equaliser for Liverpool against Chelsea in a match that will be remembered for his bite on Branislav Ivanovic.  Oscar headed in a corner to put the visitors in front but Daniel Sturridge tapped in a Suarez cross to equalise. An Eden Hazard penalty restored Chelsea's lead after a handball by Suarez, who bit defender Ivanovic's arm shortly afterwards. Suarez then levelled in the 97th minute to leave Chelsea fourth in the league. The Uruguayan guided in a header from Sturridge's cross deep into stoppage time but it is his bite on Ivanovic which will make the headlines. The misdemeanour took place following his handball from a corner as his frustrations at conceding a spot-kick seemed to get the better of him. It is not the first time he has committed such an offence: he was banned for seven games for biting PSV Eindhoven midfielder Otman Bakkal's shoulder while Ajax captain in 2010.  Referee Kevin Friend did not seem to see the incident but spoke to both players after they clashed, with Ivanovic trying to show the official a mark on his upper arm. The incident will be the main talking point of the match, which saw former Reds manager and current Chelsea boss Rafael Benitez denied an important victory on his first return to Anfield since leaving the club in 2010.  The draw leaves Chelsea a point behind third-placed Arsenal, although they have a game in hand on the Gunners, and a point ahead of fifth-placed Tottenham. The match was preceded by a minute's applause for Hillsborough campaigner Anne Williams, who passed away on Thursday, and those affected by the marathon attack on Boston, where Liverpool's club owners hail from. When the action got under way, the Reds were the first to threaten as Glen Johnson combined with Jordan Henderson and Suarez on the way to toe-poking an effort wide. However, it was Chelsea who made the breakthrough as Oscar scored with a near-post header from Juan Mata's corner following poor marking from Liverpool centre-back Daniel Agger. Reds keeper Pepe Reina nearly gifted the visitors a second when he fumbled a long-range David Luiz free-kick before gathering the ball just before it crossed the goal-line. The home side struggled to match the pace and purpose of Chelsea, although Liverpool almost equalised when Suarez ran on to a Stewart Downing pass and had an angled strike blocked by keeper Petr Cech. Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers, who was in charge of the Merseysiders for the 50th time, brought on Sturridge to try to work a way back into the game. The move almost had an instant impact as the striker slid a pass through to release Steven Gerrard, whose goal-bound shot was smartly diverted wide by the outstretched leg of Cech. Almost immediately, a rasping Sturridge strike beat Cech, only to thunder off the post before the home side's pressure paid off following a well-worked move. Downing hooked a pass back to Suarez, whose first-time cross to the far post was side-footed in by Sturridge from close range. No sooner had Liverpool got back on level terms than they were again behind. Suarez handled a corner and Hazard stepped up to send Reina the wrong way with his spot-kick. Suarez then bit Ivanovic in the Chelsea area as a Liverpool attack fizzled out, although he escaped punishment at the time. Chelsea were heading for the three points in the final minute of stoppage time, only for Suarez to nod in an equaliser. It was his 30th goal of the campaign but the focus is likely to be on the striker's conduct during the match rather than his playing exploits.

24.04.2013 23:34:10 Liverpool's faint hopes of European qualification suffered a further setback as Reading held them to a second successive draw on an afternoon of frustration. Reading goalkeeper Alex McCarthy produced a man-of-the-match display with a string of outstanding saves. Liverpool had a host of chances, with Luis Suarez going closest with a chip that was cleared off the line. Reading twice went close late on but Liverpool's Pepe Reina stood firm. This was a result that did little to cheer either manager. It was the first time in 14 months that Liverpool had failed to score in consecutive matches and although it ended a run of seven successive defeats for Reading, it did little to keep alive Nigel Adkins' increasingly desperate battle against relegation. Brendan Rodgers had warned his players of the need to take care of the "ugly bits" in order to mount a late charge for European football next season. Too often this campaign Liverpool have slipped up against teams that, on paper, they should have beaten - undermining their momentum and draining them of confidence. This was a case in point, an afternoon when both teams marked the 24th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster, Liverpool were, once again, unable to turn a turn superiority into success, possession into points. Much of that was down to the performance of 23-year-old McCarthy, who was only in the side because first-choice Adam Federici is injured, but Rodgers cut a frustrated figure at the final whistle. Liverpool should have put the result beyond doubt before half-time. For 45 minutes their front three bristled with menace - Suarez and Philippe Coutinho swapped places at will, eluding markers, confounding plans and slicing through the Reading backline. The pair almost had Liverpool ahead early on, the young Brazilian playing Suarez through only for his delicately floated chip to be headed off the line by the retreating Chris Gunter. Daniel Sturridge also went close. Coutinho was providing the vision and the craft, Suarez the quick feet and the jet heels. But while Liverpool dominated, McCarthy stood firm time and time again. He denied all three of the Reds forwards before half-time, tipping Coutinho's low shot wide, pushing Suarez's effort away and denying Sturridge from close range. Adrian Mariappa threw himself in front of Steven Gerrard's volley, but this was a familiar story for Liverpool - dominant but not decisive, style but no substance. Within five minutes of the restart Liverpool had the ball in the net, only to see Coutinho's deft back-heeled flick correctly chalked off for offside. As the time ticked away, Reading grew in confidence as they added midfield creativity to their defensive resilience. Liverpool, weighed down by the burden of expectation, lost their way. Moments after Coutinho's low shot brushed the outside of the post, Reading broke forward to create their best chance of the match. Pavel Pogrebnyak surged down the left and his low cross found Noel Hunt six yards out, only for Reina to deny the Ireland striker with an instinctive save. The Spaniard made an equally impressive stop moments later, tipping Jobi McAnuff's deflected shot over the bar as Reading sensed an opportunity to snatch all three points. Liverpool continued to threaten, however, but time and again they found McCarthy in uncompromising mood. The young goalkeeper denied Gerrard once again and twice more repelled shots from Suarez, while McAnuff's late appeal for a penalty was waved away by referee Mark Clattenburg.  Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers:  "We created enough chances to win a couple of games. We are very disappointed we didn't win.  Their goalkeeper was outstanding and on another day the goals go in. I can't ask anything more of the players except that we should have been a wee bit more clinical. It was as good a goalkeeping performance as I have seen in a long time. Young Alex has all the attributes to be a top, top 'keeper. He is 6ft 5in, he has great feet and he has made a series of fantastic saves. But I have got no complaints with my team. Our creativity and movement was very good. But we just didn't do final bit and that is to the ball in the net and that cost us."  Reading boss Nigel Adkins:  "It is three games I have been in charge at Reading now and once again our attitude and application was top drawer. First 15 minutes they had good possession but our players have kept us in the game and we have had a great opportunity with Noel Hunt late on and Pepe Reina has made a great save. It was an outstanding goalkeeper performance from Alex McCarthy. Has worked really hard to make sure we pick up a point today. It is only a one point, when we need three - we know where we are."

24.04.2013 23:34:10 Mario Balotelli marked his return to Manchester City's starting line-up with the crucial opening goal in their hard-fought win over Wigan. The Italian striker, out of favour and then injured for most of the last month, gave City the lead against the run of play with 21 minutes left, burying the loose ball after Ali Al Habsi's double save. James Milner's fierce strike moments later made sure of a victory that keeps City only a point behind Manchester United at the top of the table, but this was a far from straightforward win. Their unbeaten start to the season looked under serious threat during the second half until Balotelli struck, with the Latics enjoying long spells of pressure. City, who have struggled for goals and wins on the road this season, looked lethargic and short of ideas for long stages. And, until Balotelli struck for his first league goal since the end of March, his manager Roberto Mancini cut an increasingly unhappy figure on the touchline. Mancini's side are rock solid at the Etihad Stadium, but had scored only seven times in their six previous away league games, with their lack of goals costing them vital points in the title race. Balotelli was initially unable to change that, largely because he received so little in the way of service. City were wasteful on the ball and misplaced too many passes when they came into Wigan territory. Even David Silva, usually so reliable at finding a team-mate, was lacking his usual zip. The champions still had the occasional sight of goal early on and Sergio Aguero and Maicon both flashed shots just wide after escaping down the flanks. But, until Yaya Toure fought his way down the left by-line on the stroke of half-time and fired in a shot that Al Habsi parried at his near post, the Latics looked comfortable. Roberto Martinez's side were not just sitting back and soaking up the pressure, either. Joe Hart had to help an Arouna Kone header over the bar and Jordi Gomez sent a free-kick whistling a fraction wide. City did come out with more purpose after the break, but Balotelli was wasteful when he met Maicon's cross at the back post but sent his header bouncing well wide. Wigan were still creating the better openings and Kone's finishing was just as poor when he nodded Ronnie Stam's cross wide. The Latics went close again after the hour mark when Jean Beausejour's cross flew right across goal and Gomez, arriving late, was unable to steer it goalwards. By now the home side were on top and a point looked a decent return for City, who would have been mindful of Manchester United's catastrophic defeat here last spring. They went home with all three, mainly thanks to Balotelli. Gareth Barry's shot from the edge of the area was blocked by Al Habsi and, although the Wigan keeper stopped Balotelli's first follow-up, he could do nothing with his second strike. The Latics kept coming forward but their hopes of getting anything from the game disappeared when Milner made it 2-0, beating Al Habsi with an unstoppable shot into the top corner.

24.04.2013 23:34:10 Rafael Benitez is still seeking a first win and goal since taking charge of Chelsea after Fulham battled to earn a point from a tedious west London derby. The home fans had greeted their new manager with widespread booing during his first game in charge against Manchester City on Sunday, but they laid off him before this match. A second uninspiring display and goalless draw in four days, though, meant the jeers erupted around Stamford Bridge at the full-time whistle, the hosts' winless run stretching to six games.  West Brom's defeat at Swansea meant that the result was enough to carry the Blues up to third in the league, but at the same time the gap between them and leaders Manchester United extended to seven points. Chelsea dominated possession for much of the game but Fulham, who fully deserved their point, created as many clear chances and left-back John Arne Riise had two good opportunities to earn maximum points after the break. A fixture played against such a dissatisfied backdrop was seemingly perfect for Fulham. The sell-out away support were always going to cherish every moment of the turmoil, unrest and upset which has embroiled their local rivals in recent weeks.  Roberto Di Matteo's sacking, the fury at Benitez coming in as his replacement and the messy Mark Clattenburg affair gave Fulham fans plenty of ammunition to goad their neighbours. But the off-field shenanigans did nothing to inspire the visitors or provoke a wounded home side in a desperately dull first half. Fulham sat deep and allowed Chelsea plenty of possession but the hosts could barely muster a worthwhile attempt. Brazilians Ramires and David Luiz saw shots fly way off target, while the misfiring Fernando Torres came closest with a neat turn that could only produce a tame strike on goal. At the other end Fulham forward Hugo Rodallega had a decent shot from distance easily saved by Petr Cech. But what little entertainment there was came from the fans, who spent most of the first period questioning each other's lack of support, lack of trophies or willingness to sack managers with alarming regularity. And while Benitez escaped the expected hostile reception witnessed at the weekend, many more performances like this and he may not see out his short-term contract. His decision to leave crowd favourite Juan Mata on the bench deprived Chelsea of their most creative player on a night when they desperately needed him. A brilliantly organised and packed away defence coupled with a lack of adventure going forward allowed precious little space for Oscar and Eden Hazard to operate. Chelsea continued to dominate possession and territory after the interval but the chances still would not come. Branislav Ivanovic did glance a header wide and Torres had a goalbound half-volley cleared by Aaron Hughes. But Fulham grew in confidence in the latter stages and two great chances fell to Riise. The Norwegian wasted the first after racing clear following a swift break but he was unlucky with his second attempt when his fierce strike produced a fine low save from Cech. And although the game opened up in an increasingly frantic final 10 minutes, neither side could find a winner.  Fulham manager Martin Jol: "We could have nicked it and that would have been bad for them and great for us. "I'm not disappointed to only get a draw away from home, but disappointed we didn't make more of those chances. "After the game, everyone said Berbatov was fantastic, and he was, but the other players worked every so hard."

24.04.2013 23:34:10 Theo Walcott once again emphasised his worth to Arsenal with the goal that earned them a point at Goodison Park. Walcott - out of contract at the end of the season and with speculation surrounding his Arsenal future - came back from a shoulder injury to give the Gunners the lead after only 51 seconds. Marouane Fellaini marked his return from a one-match ban by scoring his seventh goal of the season with a fine finish before half-time but both sides had to settle for a point that did not satisfy either of their purposes. Everton's bright start to the season has now stalled with six draws in their last eight Premier League games while Arsenal picked up their second point on the road in four days following Saturday's goalless draw at Aston Villa.  Walcott was on target inside a minute when he exchanged passes with Aaron Ramsey and curled a finish high past Everton keeper Tim Howard with the help of a deflection. Arsenal's bright start suffered an early blow when Laurent Koscielny pulled up with what looked like a muscle injury and was replaced by Kieran Gibbs. Everton were rocked back but were able to build momentum as the half progressed, with Fellaini inevitably the inspiration behind most of their best work. The giant Belgian had a downward header saved by keeper Wojciech Szczesny before Everton pressurised Arsenal into a mistake and were rewarded with the equaliser after 28 minutes. Steven Pienaar, another lively first-half figure, forced Bacary Sagna into conceding possession, allowing Fellaini to pick the ball up 20 yards out and sweep a low left-foot shot past Szczesny. Everton ended the half on top as Nikica Jelavic turned superbly inside the area only to shoot over. The Croatian then brought an end to another dangerous attack when he unwisely interrupted a surging run from Leighton Baines by taking possession in what was clearly an offside position. The second half produced more sparring than moments of genuine quality, although Szczesny reacted superbly to turn away Sylvain Distin's header from a Baines cross and Howard needed to react to block a snap shot from Santi Cazorla. Everton also had very presentable penalty claims ignored by referee Michael Oliver when Mikel Arteta appeared to drag Pienaar back as he advanced into the area, much to Goodison Park's obvious disgust. Jelavic had suffered a frustrating evening but did provide two superb crosses only to see no team-mate on the end of his inviting deliveries. Substitute Gervinho failed to get a touch on the end of Olivier Giroud's cross - but there was to be no winner of a largely undistinguished affair.

24.04.2013 23:34:10 Referee Mark Clattenburg's return was overshadowed by a terrible mistake from Southampton goalkeeper Paulo Gazzaniga that gifted Norwich a point. Clattenburg was in charge for the first time since Chelsea made a false accusation of racial abuse against him. But Gazzaniga's poor attempt to stop Robert Snodgrass's free-kick in the 45th minute was the talking point. The goal cancelled out Rickie Lambert's 32nd-minute finish after a free-kick deflected to him off Grant Holt. Clattenburg was applauded by fans as he warmed up for his first game since the match between Chelsea and Manchester United on 28 October. And he had an easy night with the only decision open to contention surrounding Lambert's goal. Before the ball dropped for him off Norwich skipper Holt it bounced up off his arm. Norwich appealed for a free-kick but Lambert knew little about the ball until it smacked his limb. The goal was fully deserved as Southampton had run the opening stages of the game. They felt they should have been awarded a penalty when defender Sebastien Bassong used his shoulder to barge Adam Lallana to the ground as the pair tussled for a ball, but Clattenburg was not interested. Lallana's next foray into the box almost brought the opener. Lambert picked him out superbly with a cross the Saints captain caught on the volley and watched fly just over the bar. Southampton did not have to wait much longer for their opener, though, with Lambert scoring his sixth of the season. It should have triggered a flurry of goals, but instead Southampton's Achilles heel of letting leads slip returned to haunt them again. Nigel Adkins's men had shipped 13 points from winning positions before this game and they let more fall through their fingers just before the break. Snodgrass's low free-kick beat the wall but looked an easy stop for Gazzaniga. That was until the 20-year-old Argentine let the ball bounce under him. Gazzaniga is the third keeper Southampton have used this season after Kelvin Davis and Artur Boruc both failed to nail down their place in what is proving a problem position for the south coast club. The keeper partly redeemed himself by making a point-blank stop to keep out Holt's header from a corner early in the second half, and that gave Southampton hope of recording a third successive win. Jason Puncheon tested keeper Mark Bunn, called up after first choice John Ruddy was ruled out for three months with a thigh injury, with a shot that was threatening to arrow into the bottom corner. Lallana then latched onto a Lambert knockdown and drilled a shot over the bar. Southampton's final chance of the night dropped to Lambert, who powered an effort from distance off target. That miss ensured Norwich extended their unbeaten run to seven matches and left Southampton in the relegation zone.

24.04.2013 23:34:10 Newcastle slid to a fourth successive league defeat for the first time since 2008 as Stoke came from behind with two late goals in four minutes to go ninth. Following a forgettable first half, Newcastle went ahead when Papiss Cisse converted a rebound after Demba Ba's shot was parried by Asmir Begovic. Newcastle had chances for a second but Jon Walters equalised with a glancing header from Cameron Jerome's cross. Jerome hit the winner after a knockdown from fellow substitute Kenwyne Jones. Cisse's only previous league goal this term inadvertently deflected in off his rear end when Newcastle last recorded a league victory against West Brom at the end of October, and it seemed as though he might have provided a morale-boosting win again. Given their wretched run, a midweek visit to have their feathers ruffled by Stoke, unbeaten at home since February, was a far from ideal assignment for the Magpies, again significantly weakened by the absence of influential midfielders Yohan Cabaye and Hatem Ben Arfa through injury. But roared on by the Toon Army, they looked neater in possession and were largely inconvenienced in the first period. The game was littered with misplaced passes, however, with Newcastle defender Mike Williamson's skewed clearance against his own post the closest to breaking the deadlock before the break. Matthew Etherington was clear down the left flank but his centre was over-hit and too far in front of the well-placed Charlie Adam in the area, rather summing up the opening period. Two players sustained nasty cuts in separate incidents and both were from Stoke, Geoff Cameron returning with a new shirt but Peter Crouch forced off after losing teeth when caught by Fabricio Coloccini's stray arm in an aerial challenge. The game was in urgent need of a goal and it came from the visitors, who hustled Glenn Whelan out of possession to allow Ba to fire a low effort that bounced awkwardly in front of Begovic and Cisse was alert to hook in left-footed off the inside of the post, scuppering Stoke's hopes of a sixth clean sheet at the Britannia Stadium this term. With the home side struggling to find a way back into the contest, Newcastle had penalty claims for handball swiftly dismissed, while Cisse might have added a second when he sprinted clear to collect goalkeeper Tim Krul's long clearance, but his angled shot was pushed aside by Begovic. The goalkeeper then saved with his legs in an almost identical scenario when Ba broke through. Those saves proved crucial as Stoke finally exerted some sustained pressure, and moments after Jones headed straight at Krul, Jerome crossed for Walters to get in front of his marker and direct a header into the top corner. The tide had turned, the hosts sensed victory and it duly arrived when Jones knocked a long ball down invitingly for Jerome to slot home first-time from 15 yards. It extended Stoke's unbeaten home record to 14 matches and ensured increased concern for Newcastle, who remain without an away win this season.  Stoke manager Tony Pulis:  "We won't get carried away, we've had a couple of very good results at home, to take six points from Fulham and Newcastle is very, very pleasing but at this football club whether we're third from bottom or ninth it makes no difference, we just carry on what we do and we do it to the best of our ability. "We were unlucky first half with the one that hits the post, if that goes in it takes some pressure off, and when they score from a mistake by Asmir [Begovic] who should do better than that, you think it's not going to be your night. "Couple of substitutions, Cameron Jerome and Michael Kightly added some pace and power to it and I think in the end we deserved to win the game. "Cameron and Kenwyne [Jones] haven't played many games this year but their attitudes have been first class. It's very difficult keeping players happy who are not in the team but Cameron has shown his class, it was a great finish, the crowd were at their best and they almost suck the ball into the net."  Newcastle boss Alan Pardew:  "After 75 minutes we were bossing the game, 1-0 up looking like we were going to get a second, I thought we had a definite penalty that wasn't given, and two sucker punches have cost us. "I feel so sorry for the players because it's been a tough little spell for us with the blows we've had on the injury front and we've put in a really great performance here and ended up with nothing, it's hard to look your players in the eye and say you've carried the gameplan through and got nothing. "Obviously goals do change the situation but I felt the least we deserved was a draw so the second goal was a real bad one. "It's the run of results that's the problem and we've got to stop that, we couldn't have done anymore to stop it tonight and unfortunately we've just come up short, the players were magnificent tonight, I couldn't say that Sunday but I can tonight.

24.04.2013 23:34:10 Winger Wayne Routledge scored a brace after top-scorer Michu's early opener as Swansea took West Brom apart. Michu took his goal tally to eight from close range and Routledge deflected in after Jonas Olsson failed to clear, before netting a sublime second. On-loan striker Romelu Lukaku smashed in for West Brom just before half-time. The away side failed to produce any clear cut chances in the second half, as Spaniard Michu came close to adding another late on. West Brom's superb start to the season was blown away by a Swansea performance that saw them outpass and outclass their opponents. Manager Steve Clarke has been receiving plaudits for the way he has started his managerial career and the Baggies had been tipped for a European competition spot after their impressive start. But on this form, the Scot will need to re-evaluate his side's chances of a top six finish in May. On the other hand, Michael Laudrup's men have suffered just one defeat in their last eight league games, and look well set to build on their excellent debut season in the Premier League. Pablo Hernandez, a summer signing from Valencia, was central to everything the Swans created, typifying the team's ethos; calm, collected and extremely comfortable every time he was in possession. The home side started brightly with their crisp, passing style of play, a pattern that continued throughout the first half. Spaniard Hernandez linked up with Michu early on and the Swans forward struck the foot of the post. It was the same combination that gave the home side the lead, as Nathan Dyer's cross was knocked back by Hernandez for a simple tap-in for Michu. And their blistering start enabled them to make it two within the opening 11 minutes. Hernandez's trickery was West Brom's undoing as he skipped past two defenders before laying on for Routledge who bundled home after Olsson's attempted clearance. After winning their previous four games, West Brom were in unfamiliar territory. Lukaku was stranded up front on his own and Peter Odemwingie could only fire a shot towards Gerhard Tremmel's goal out of frustration. Swansea went further ahead with Hernandez involved yet again, laying on Ben Davies. The left-back found Routledge, who nonchalantly struck a first-time finish with the outside of his foot. Having created nothing all half, West Brom somehow managed to get back into the game on the stroke of half time with an emphatic finish from Lukaku after Chris Brunt's corner. The visitors attempted to claw their way back into the match but came up against a resolute Swansea defence. In fact, it was Swansea who should have extended their lead as Michu flashed a header wide, before stinging the palms of Boaz Myhill.  Swansea manager Michael Laudrup:  "The first half was one of the few times as a manager that you are just watching the game, it was a delightful, it was fantastic. "We also saw the quality and attitude but the mental part is important too because they scored late in the first half. "It was a great team performance and I don't want to single out any individual performance. "Everybody was great to watch. We have the momentum and we want to keep it now."  West Brom manager Steve Clarke:  "We started slowly and got punished, and got punished by the better team. We did not get out of the blocks. "At 3-0 down you are a long way from getting anything from the game. "The goal gave us a glimmer of hope but we move on to the next game now. "Swansea are a really good team and we knew it would be difficult and they proved that."

24.04.2013 23:34:10 First-half goals from Aaron Lennon and Gareth Bale were enough to give Tottenham victory over Liverpool in a superb encounter at White Hart Lane. Lennon opened the scoring inside the first 10 minutes when he tapped in Bale's low cross from the left at the far post. Bale added a second when his 25-yard free-kick left Reds goalkeeper Pepe Reina virtually motionless on the line. Liverpool pulled one back when the unlucky Bale headed into his own net. Buoyed by that lifeline, the Reds pressed hard for an equaliser. Striker Luis Suarez went close with a volley following great acrobatics from Daniel Agger, while Jose Enrique, who almost scored on two other occasions, saw his shot drift inches past the post. The victory moves Spurs above Arsenal and into the top five, with Liverpool down to 12th. In the previous 40 Premier League encounters between the teams, 109 goals had been scored at more than 2.5 goals per game, while both Liverpool forward Suarez and Tottenham counterpart Jermain Defoe had the most shots on target - 34 and 30 - in the top flight this season. And once again the teams delivered during another fascinating Premier League encounter. Bale shone brightest in the early stages. The Wales left-winger forced Reina into an ungainly save from his free-kick before launching a trademark angled shot, which went wide by two feet. But on his next foray forward, Spurs scored. Yet again Bale embarrassed Liverpool down the left with his pace and picked out Lennon with a surgical pass, the England international tapping in at the far post. Tottenham were on the rampage and they got their second nine minutes later when Reina failed to judge the flight of Bale's free-kick and he was left rooted to the spot as the ball flew in. The potent Suarez, who also has fired in the most shots of any player in the league this season - 69 - had tested Hugo Lloris in the first 10 minutes with a low shot, before going even closer later in the opening half. On that occasion the sprightly Uruguayan flicked the loose ball towards goal after Lloris had come out to block Steven Gerrard's shot, only to see Kyle Walker win the race to the line and hook his effort to safety. It was a magnificent piece of defending by the England international. The Reds claimed Gerrard was fouled by Mousa Dembele in the build-up, but referee Phil Dowd waved away appeals. Liverpool midfielder Jordan Henderson, who was later substituted, also missed an open goal from 20 yards, but he was under pressure from the Spurs defence, while Enrique had his turn-and-shot saved by France keeper Lloris. Enrique, who attacked at nearly every opportunity, also went close midway through the second half when his shot from eight yards was deflected wide for a corner. The Reds finally made their breakthrough from the resulting set-piece when substitute Jonjo Shelvey's corner from the right was flicked on to Gerrard by Daniel Agger. The England midfielder directed his headed effort towards goal, where Lennon hacked it off the line, but the ball smashed into Bale two yards away and he inadvertently headed into his own net. Liverpool were on top in the closing moments but a combination of fortune and good defending ensured Spurs earned a second consecutive league win.

24.04.2013 23:34:10 Aston Villa moved out of the Premier League bottom three thanks to Christian Benteke's late goal against Reading. The Belgian striker headed in the winner from a corner late on to leave the Royals one place off the bottom. Villa, who left striker Darren Bent out of the team for the second match in succession, also went close through Andreas Weimann and Ciaran Clark. Reading's best chance fell to Hal Robson-Kanu, who had his goalbound shot blocked by Brad Guzan. Sean Morrison and Adam Le Fondre also wasted golden chances - both heading wide from close range. Brian McDermott's promoted side are now four points adrift of safety and with Manchester United, Southampton and Sunderland coming up they face a tricky few weeks. The Royals were expected to find the going tough this season, but not as many people thought Villa would struggle under the stewardship of Paul Lambert, who performed wonders at Norwich. Villa came into the match having only managed one win in nine, but on the back of a good performance against Arsenal. Lambert's side had only scored 10 goals in 13 league games this season and only three at home - fewer than any other side. Key striker Bent, who signed for the club in a Â£24m deal in 2011, was left out of the team to face the Gunners despite having recovered from an ankle injury and the England man was once again omitted. The Villa manager might have been left rueing the decision with two of his three attackers - Weimann and Benteke - missing great opportunities during the match. The first fell to 21-year-old Belgian Benteke, who tamely struck a low shot into the arms of Adam Federici from 15 yards after finding himself clear. The second - arguably the easier - was wasted by Austrian Weimann, who smashed Benteke's square ball high over the bar from eight yards. Defender Nathan Baker was also left cursing his misfortune when his header from a corner bounced into the ground and over the bar. Reading, a point and a place below Villa going into the game, also created chances to open the scoring in the first half, with United States keeper Guzan brilliantly blocking Robson-Kanu's shot and Morrison sending his header foot wide. Lax defending was a major theme of the match, as was profligacy in front of goal. Further opportunities followed after the break, with Guzan using his feet to stop Jason Roberts's effort, while Le Fondre inexplicably nodded over from six yards. Villa kept the pressure on the Royals with Clark flicking his header wide when clear and Brett Holman shooting into the side-netting. It seemed the breakthrough would never come, but with 10 minutes to go summer signing Benteke used his physical prowess to climb above Morrison and head in.

24.04.2013 23:34:11 Harry Redknapp inspired an improved display from Queens Park Rangers in his first game in charge as the Londoners secured a goalless draw at Sunderland. As Redknapp had demanded before kick-off, Rangers put in a committed display and created more goalscoring chances. But Djibril Cisse failed to convert a trio of efforts while Jamie Mackie and Adel Taarabt both saw shots blocked. Sunderland also put in plenty of effort but Steven Fletcher's saved shot was the closest they came to a goal. The result does little to drastically improve either side's position at the bottom end of the Premier League table, with QPR still rock-bottom having claimed a joint record worst haul of five points from 14 games, while Sunderland are still only two points above the relegation zone. Redknapp had an immediate rejuvenating effect when he took over at Portsmouth in December 2005 and then Tottenham three years later (the less said about his spell at Southampton the better) but he himself has admitted the size of the task at QPR eclipses his earlier jobs. The reasons for this are clear, namely a pitiful points haul after 14 games and a side that is woefully lacking in cohesion and confidence, but there was enough on display in the north east of England to give the 65-year-old belief that another feat of Premier League escapology is a possibility. However, while Redknapp has brought an injection of hope to QPR, Sunderland boss Martin O'Neill remains in search of a solution to the stagnation that has set in at the Stadium of Light as he approaches the first anniversary of his appointment. The Black Cats had fight but little inspiration and while rumours of O'Neill's demise at the weekend were wide of the mark, a continued failure to accrue significant points will add further fuel to the fire. Unsurprisingly in the circumstances the game was played at frantic pace with little precision or fluency, especially in intermittent torrential rain, but it was an entertaining affair during which both sides had their chances. QPR striker Cisse - producing one of his engaged performances that have been scarce this season - could have opened the scoring on three occasions in the first half but his unmarked back-post header and curling shot from the edge of the box were both saved by home keeper Simon Mignolet and his 25-yard pile-driver flew a yard past the top corner. The visiting side's best two chances both came in the same move as Mackie ran clear into the box before his shot was well saved by Mignolet, with Phil Bardsley flinging himself in front of Taarabt's follow-up. Sunderland striker Fletcher was too often an isolated figure in attack but nevertheless could have swung the game in his side's favour. In the first half, Adam Johnson put him through in the box with a neat flick but Julio Cesar got down to save, while in the second he was denied by the Brazilian's half-time replacement Robert Green from a header. Had Stephane Mbia's 25-yard drive been a yard or two to the right it could have given Redknapp the perfect start to his Rangers reign but he will take solace from a first point in five games and a performance with promise.

24.04.2013 23:34:11 Rafael Benitez suffered a fiercely hostile reception from Chelsea's supporters as his managerial reign opened with a goalless draw against Premier League champions Manchester City at Stamford Bridge. Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich appointed the former Liverpool manager on an interim basis after sacking Roberto Di Matteo only six months after winning the Champions League and FA Cup. Benitez's arrival has met with an angry response from Chelsea fans in the wake of his old rivalry with them during his time at Anfield - and they made their strength of feeling abundantly clear. The Spaniard was met with deafening jeers when he arrived in the technical area before kick-off, with the stadium announcer struggling to make himself heard ahead of a minute's applause for former Chelsea manager Dave Sexton, who has passed away.  The mediocre affair did little to lift spirits, with City, still unbeaten in the league, marginally the better side but unable to fashion the victory that would have taken them back above Manchester United at the top of the table. Benitez was left with plenty to ponder after the frosty response from his own fans, who directed abusive chants at him during the game and also delivered a minute's applause for Di Matteo after 16 minutes, in honour of the Italian who wore the number 16 shirt as a player. And there was no instant revival for Fernando Torres as he struggled once more - although Benitez will be pleased with a clean sheet. The antipathy directed towards Benitez continued throughout a subdued first half, with City creating what few opportunities there were. David Silva headed off target from an inviting cross from Pablo Zabaleta, who saw a shot from the edge of the area blocked by Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech. Sergio Aguero missed City's best chance four minutes before half-time, heading straight at Cech from eight yards after being set up by strike partner Edin Dzeko. One of Benitez's priorities is to rekindle the fire in Torres and it was clear Chelsea's game had undergone a swift shift in emphasis, with an obvious increase in the number of long balls being hit towards the striker. On this occasion, though, it made life even easier for City captain Vincent Kompany. Torres came to life on the hour when a loose ball fell in his direction in the area but he could only fire a rising left foot drive narrowly over the bar. In a torrential downpour, moments of quality were scarce although Chelsea had an anxious moment as the game entered its final 10 minutes as Cech was forced to divert James Milner's cross with his legs. Benitez had remained largely impassive but moved to question the fourth official when Ashley Cole's late shot was clearly turned over by City keeper Joe Hart only for referee Chris Foy to award a goal-kick. It almost counted as a moment of high drama in a game that was, to put it politely, subdued and low key.  Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini:  "Games here are always hard but we played well while missing the last pass. We were too soft when we arrived near the box, you can play well, like we did, and not win the game. "We had the better chances, I think that we lost two points. We dominated the first half, but the second half was not quite like that. "It was difficult for them [with the atmosphere about Rafael Benitez], but we played well. Last year we lost a good game, this year we took one point. I am not happy but I prefer this."

24.04.2013 23:34:11 Southampton and West Ham moved closer to sealing their Premier League status with a hard-earned draw at St Mary's. Rickie Lambert saw an effort clawed onto the post by West Ham keeper Jussi Jaaskelainen while Hammers striker Andy Carroll volleyed wide from close range. Gaston Ramirez fired Saints into the lead with a clinical finish after his initial shot was blocked. But Carroll levelled the game with a low free-kick under the Saints wall as both teams moved onto 38 points. And with the 40-point mark the unofficial target for survival, both sides will now feel comfortable that they will be playing in the Premier League next season. Southampton, who were promoted with the Hammers last season, have five games remaining while West Ham still have six to play. Both started brightly despite difficult conditions with a rain-soaked pitch responsible for a first half that was littered with poor challenges. Artur Boruc was the first keeper to be tested, West Ham captain Kevin Nolan forcing a low save from 12 yards, moments before Ricardo Vaz Te fizzed a shot over the crossbar. Joey O'Brien was lucky to escape punishment for the Hammers after a late challenge on Morgan Schneiderlin - who himself was booked for diving earlier in the half. Danny Fox followed team-mate Schneiderlin into the book for an awful lunge on Guy Demel in what was proving to be a physical encounter that boiled over several times. But it was the hosts who twice came close to breaking the deadlock and both times it was their top scorer Lambert who threatened to add to his 14 goals this season. First he was denied by a wonderful save from Jaaskelainen who clawed his sliding effort from Ramirez's in-swinging free-kick onto the back post and away to safety. And then just before the break Lambert flashed a header inches wide of Jaaskelainen's far post from Jack Cork's cross. Carroll, who had been anonymous in the first half, went close to opening the scoring but inexplicably volleyed wide from eight yards with the goal gaping. And Ramirez made West Ham pay for that miss, firing Saints ahead with a fierce strike from just inside the box. Having seen his initial shot charged down by James Collins he collected the rebound before firing past the on-rushing Jaaskelainen. But Saints could only hold onto their lead for four minutes with Carroll firing his free-kick under the wall and past the wrong-footed Boruc after a slight deflection for what was only West Ham's 10th away goal all season. Carroll tested the keeper again with a low drive with 15 minutes remaining as both sides tired as a result of the conditions. The introductions of Jay Rodriguez and Jason Puncheon provided Southampton with a needed injection of pace. And Rodriguez almost won the game late on with a direct run at the Hammers defence with his rasping low effort well saved by Jaaskelainen as the game ended level.  Southampton manager Mauricio Pochettino:  "I do think we deserved the victory. We worked superbly and were better than them. "We knew they would be physical and direct but I want to congratulate my players because we managed to impose our brand of football even though the pitch suited them. "It's a shame we conceded so quickly but it was an unfortunate moment in the game and these things happen in football. "I'm content, especially considering the virus we had in the squad this week, but unhappy that we didn't get the three points we deserved."  West Ham boss Sam Allardyce:  "In the end I thought we were more than comfortable. Away goals have been our problem all season and we again created some simple chances which we didn't convert. "There are six games left, we have 38 points and are in a nice position in the league. "We have four games at home, two away, and our home form has been good this season. We should finish strongly, see how many points we can pick up and see where we can finish. I can't see us losing six on the trot with the way the lads are playing." On his contract situation, he added: "When it is all tied up we want to put pen to paper and then we can move on with next season. I will have a chat with the owners and hopefully by the end of the week I would have secured our future."

24.04.2013 23:34:11 Jermain Defoe scored twice against his former club as Tottenham beat West Ham to end a run of three league defeats. Gareth Bale hit the bar before Defoe opened the scoring with a superb run from the right and crunching finish. After rattling the bar himself, Clint Dempsey found Bale in the box and he beat Jussi Jaaskelainen via a post. Aaron Lennon broke free and squared for Defoe to seal the points, although Andy Carroll's header ended the Liverpool loanee's 15-game wait for a goal. Unfortunately for Carroll and West Ham, who came close to further reducing the deficit late on, the effort was a mere consolation. It means Tottenham climb above the Hammers into seventh, with Sam Allardyce's men facing a tough run of fixtures in December. Spurs will be delighted to end a run of four straight domestic defeats and collect only their third win in 10 matches in all competitions. Despite the poor results of late, Tottenham manager Andre Villas-Boas would have expected a return to form against a club who have not left White Hart Lane with maximum points since 1999. Indeed, they began with the belief that victory was compulsory - dominating possession and getting forward in numbers. Defoe had two early sighters before Bale spun Mark Noble and crashed a 20-yard drive against the woodwork. But West Ham had conceded the third-fewest goals in the Premier League this season and, for a time, it was easy to see why. Typically well-drilled by Allardyce, their defence, midfield and attack work in unison to grant opponents minimal time and space. But an approach focusing so heavily on containment leaves little scope to attack and a team that has scored just five away goals this season did not once trouble Hugo Lloris in the first half. While it was a fairly dour 45 minutes, if anyone deserved the opener it was Tottenham - and their reward arrived just before the break. Defoe outmuscled Winston Reid and George McCartney on the right touchline before making his way inside, sidestepping Noble and sending a venomous finish past Jaaskelainen. It was a moment of class the match badly needed and meant West Ham had to adopt a more positive approach in the second half. They obliged when Kevin Nolan broke clear on right and sent in a low cross towards substitute Matt Jarvis, only for Lloris to gather well. The problem with West Ham's greater ambition was that it left them exposed at the back, and Spurs took full advantage. Dempsey - replacing the suspended Emmanuel Adebayor in support of Defoe - became increasingly influential and was unfortunate to see a strike come back off the bar. Within a minute he was involved again, scooping a pass through for Bale who kept his balance and beat Jaaskelainen via a post. Tottenham were now in total control and extended their lead when midfield pressure from Tom Huddlestone and Sandro allowed Dempsey to release Lennon, who squared for Defoe to tap home into an unguarded net. Carroll managed to nod in Joey O'Brien's cross and West Ham pushed hard for a second, but Tottenham held on to their advantage and will be buoyed heading into Wednesday's visit of Liverpool.  Tottenham manager Andre Villas-Boas:  "It was a good 90-minute performance, very solid, and we kept creating. It's difficult to defend long balls and crosses into box, but the boys did extremely well to handle the situation. "We played two away games at top teams [Manchester City and Arsenal] and played well but didn't get the results we wanted. Getting back to winning ways was extremely important. "Defoe is a great player in a great moment of form. His desire and hunger are immense. He works hard and lives off scoring. He's having a great season."  West Ham manager Sam Allardyce:  "It looked like we didn't recover from the first goal, which is disappointing because we still had a very good chance if we came out and played like we can. We were relying a lot on good defensive work and that let us down in the end. "We launched a spirited comeback but it was far too late. It's a bad day for me watching the lads play like they did. None of the players played their best and ended up being beaten comfortably. "Our goal provides a platform to the players to show where to put the ball. If they put it in the rights areas Andy Carroll will score and he showed that with his header. Hopefully he can get on a bit of a run."

24.04.2013 23:34:11 Southampton climbed out of the Premier League relegation zone as they convincingly beat Newcastle. The livewire Gaston Ramirez squared the ball across for Adam Lallana to slot in the home side's opener. Newcastle's Vurnon Anita missed a gilt-edged chance before Ramirez pounced for a Saints second after keeper Tim Krul parried a Jason Puncheon cross. Puncheon and team-mate Jose Fonte were denied by the woodwork as the home side ran out comfortable victors. Saints substitute Jay Rodriguez also had an effort dubiously ruled out for offside in the closing stages of a match in which the two-goal scoreline flattered a Newcastle side who did not come close to matching the attacking verve and defensive durability of their hosts. The home side earned back-to-back top flight wins for the first time this season as evidence mounted that they are acclimatising to the rigours of the Premier League following a tough start to the season. In contrast, the manner of a third successive league defeat for the Magpies will worry manager Alan Pardew, who endured an unhappy return to his former club. Pardew managed Southampton for 13 months before being sacked by the then League One club in August 2010 and, although he felt that decision was "harsh", there was nothing undeserved about his side's latest loss. Playmaker Ramirez was the inspiration for the home side's win along with captain Lallana and forward Rickie Lambert, who was signed by Pardew for Southampton. The tone of the game was set early on when an overworked Newcastle keeper Tim Krul palmed away a 25-yard Ramirez free-kick and also had to block a strike from Puncheon. A sweetly-struck long range Lambert free-kick cannoned off the corner of the goalframe before the home side's pressure finally told. A Krul clearance only found home defender Nathaniel Clyne, whose long range effort to catch the keeper off his line was only partially headed away by Magpies centre-back Mike Williamson. The menacing Ramirez latched on to the loose ball and crossed low for Lallana to tap in. Newcastle briefly improved after the break and Anita should have done better than shoot too close to keeper Paulo Gazzaniga when clean through. The miss was soon punished as Southampton extended their lead in lovely style. Lallana's backheel released Puncheon and his cross was only parried by Krul, which allowed Ramirez to force in a close range shot. The home side were constantly scything through Newcastle in impressive style and went close to extending their lead on several occasions. A Puncheon shot and Fonte header both hit the Newcastle woodwork while, thanks to a smart Gazzaniga save from Davide Santon's powerful header, Southampton also kept their first clean sheet of the league season to go with the three points.  Southampton manager Nigel Adkins:  "It was a good win. We created a lot of opportunities and their goalkeeper also made a lot of saves. "It was a thoroughly deserved win and we kept a clean sheet as well. There is a growing maturity about the players. There is a momentum with us and we are playing some really good football consistently through a game. "The standard of play, as individuals and as a team, is improving all the time."

24.04.2013 23:34:11 Brendan Rodgers was frustrated on his return to the Liberty Stadium as his Liverpool side were held to a draw by Swansea City in the Premier League. Liverpool had Jose Enrique's close-range effort ruled out for offside, and Raheem Sterling hit the crossbar with a volley. Swansea's best chance fell to Ashley Williams who saw a powerful header cleared off the line by Joe Allen. The result lifts Swansea to eighth in the table with Liverpool 11th. It was Liverpool's eighth successive game without defeat in the Premier League, while Swansea have lost just once in their last seven league outings. The match also saw Swansea keep a clean sheet for the first time in 11 league matches. Liverpool manager Rodgers was met with a mixture of applause and a few boos when he emerged from the tunnel in Swansea for the first time since leaving the Swans for Anfield in May.  His last match in charge of Swansea had been against Liverpool at the end of last season. But the pre-match controversy surrounding Williams' comments about Luis Suarez in his autobiography appeared to be forgotten as the players smiled and shook hands before kick-off.  Swans captain Williams said in his book that he wanted to "knock out" Suarez during last season's game at Anfield and accused him of diving.  Liverpool had the better of the first half chances. Sterling hit the crossbar with a vicious right foot volley and Swans' goalkeeper Gerhard Tremmel saved well when Glen Johnson was clean through. The Reds had the ball in the back of the net when Enrique stole in at the back post to slot the ball past Tremmel. But the goal was ruled out for a marginal offside. Pepe Reina had a relatively quiet time in the Liverpool goal, but did have to save a sharp near-post shot by Wayne Routledge. Swansea manager Michael Laudrup made a tactical change at the start of the second half, bringing South Korean international Ki Sung-yeung on for Itay Schechter. That allowed Michu to move into the attack with Ki filling in the gap left in the Swans' midfield. Williams sent a powerful header towards the Liverpool goal from a De Guzman corner, but saw his former team-mate Allen clear the ball off the line. A Pablo Hernandez free-kick forced a fine save from Reina late on after Allen had fouled Ki on the edge of the box. But Liverpool finished stronger, with Jonjo Shelvey forcing Tremmel into a save with a powerful drive from 20 yards in added time.  Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers  said of Enrique's disallowed goal: "I thought it was a goal to be honest. "I understand that when you see it now and you see lots of replays and people talk about parts of the body being offside, but the only part of his body that looked offside was his arm. "So I thought it was a wee bit harsh on us because he's come in, gambled on the ball coming in and he's got his reward for it, but unfortunately we didn't get the goal. "I was very pleased with my team today, the method in our game was excellent. We had 18 shots at goal, nine on target, we just couldn't quite find the final touch to finish."  Swansea City manager Michael Laudrup  said: "I think it was a good point. "In the first half they had more chances than us but we had chances too and I am pleased with the performance. "You know when you play against Suarez and Gerrard they can always invent something, but I think we handled it well. "There has been a lot of talk about Suarez and Ashley [Williams] and today we saw two guys trying to do their best. "Suarez did some good things, but maybe less than he is used to as he played against two guys who did very well."

24.04.2013 23:34:11 Aston Villa edged out of the relegation zone with a drab goalless draw against Arsenal at rain-soaked Villa Park. In an uneventful first half, Andreas Weimann saw a strike ruled out for offside and Laurent Koscielny shot over when well placed. The second half was far more open and Aaron Ramsey went close before Brett Holman's drive was tipped on to the bar by Wojciech Szczesny. Arsenal pushed for a late winner but were forced to settle for a point. It meant they missed the chance to replace Everton in fifth, while Villa go above Reading in 17th, although the Royals have a game in hand. If Arsene Wenger truly believes his team are in contention for the title, he must be disappointed to see them fall 10 points behind leaders Manchester United. Villa boss Paul Lambert, by contrast, will take heart from his side's display following defeats by United and City, and heading into crucial meetings with Reading, QPR, Stoke and Norwich. He knew a response was needed following last weekend's 5-0 loss at Etihad Stadium and, while it duly arrived, they could have taken all three points with the help of a proven goalscorer. Some may point to Darren Bent's omission from the matchday squad when he was fit to play after an ankle injury. Promising forwards Weimann and Christian Benteke were a constant threat, yet neither carry the potency of an in-form Bent. Weimann tested Szczesny with an early cross-come-shot and Benteke headed wide from Ashley Westwood's corner. Arsenal took 20 minutes to create a chance, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain shooting wide and Brad Guzan saving well from Ramsey. An uninspiring half almost came to life as Ciaran Clark's drive made its way to Weimann, only for his strike to be disallowed. At the other end, an unmarked Koscielny wasted a glorious opportunity with a wayward finish from Olivier Giroud's low cross. Villa's trend this season has been to impress in the first half before fading in the second, and for Arsenal it has been the opposite. The Gunners signalled their intent after the break through Santi Cazorla's strike, which sailed just off target at the end of a slick move. Ron Vlaar's injury-enforced substitution enabled Arsenal to find gaps and Ramsey might have done better on two occasions. With the match now open, Szczesny's fingertips and the woodwork denied substitute Holman from distance. Wenger's search for a goal led to the introduction of Andrey Arshavin and Gervinho, and an Arshavin cross was brilliantly intercepted by Clark with his fellow replacement waiting to pounce. But Arsenal were poor and their fans made their displeasure clear.  Aston Villa manager Paul Lambert:  "It's a long project. It's never going to happen overnight. I thought today we were well worth something. They are a young side but they are growing every time they play. "It's a really tough run we have had with Manchester United, Manchester City and Arsenal. "People might have thought we would get nothing. We have got a point but the performances have been excellent."  Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger:  "Complaints? No, because we tried. We had the right attitude but lacked a bit of fluency and accuracy in the final third. When we had the opportunities to be dangerous we didn't use them well. "I think it's down to fatigue. We had not completely recovered from Wednesday night. They [Thomas Vermaelen, Jack Wilshere and Bacary Sagna] were all on the edge. "For Jack, it was a sensible thing. If you play him every game people reproach you and if you don't play him they reproach you. It's a lose-lose situation. I do what I think is right I and think it was the right decision. "We're a very offensive team - we played with three strikers - but that doesn't mean you score goals. It can happen;, it has happened before. It's difficult away from home."

24.04.2013 23:34:11 Sebastien Bassong's 90th-minute header denied Everton victory and extended Norwich's unbeaten run to six Premier League games. Steven Naismith put the Toffees ahead early on, powering into the roof of the net after good work by Bryan Oviedo. But Everton faded after their bright start and Norwich began to threaten. Robert Snodgrass had a shot cleared off the line and Anthony Pilkington went close, before Bassong met Javier Garrido's free-kick to snatch a point. Everton were unhappy with the decision that led to Norwich's equaliser, with referee Mike Jones spotting a push on Steve Morison by Leighton Baines. But in truth the Toffees only had themselves to blame for their failure to turn their early dominance into more goals, and for allowing Norwich back into the game. Everton remain fifth in the table, having drawn five of their last seven games, but they are three points behind fourth-placed Chelsea having played a game more, and they will know they have wasted another opportunity to close the gap on the sides above them. David Moyes's side certainly began the game well enough, and were first to threaten when Sylvain Distin found Naismith with a long diagonal ball and he teed up Leon Osman to curl a shot wide. The home side kept the pressure up and took the lead after 12 minutes. Steven Whittaker was unable to deal with Thomas Hitzlsperger's lofted pass down the left, allowing Oviedo to cut in and find Naismith, who buried his first-time strike. That was only the second goal a newly resolute Norwich side had conceded in a run of three wins and two draws in the league since a 4-1 defeat by Chelsea on 6 October. But more looked likely to quickly follow, with Everton's midfield dominating thanks to some quick-fire passing. Further chances duly arrived, with Baines forcing Ruddy into a fine low save from the best of them. In contrast, Norwich did not test Tim Howard inside the first 30 minutes, but things began to change when Grant Holt went on a rampaging run, battling past two defenders before screwing his shot wide. The Toffees got lucky before the break when Bassong met a Snodgrass corner but saw the ball come off his shoulder and bounce wide. And, having seen his side surrender a first-half lead in their defeat by Reading last week, the alarm bells were surely ringing for Moyes as his side made a sluggish start to the second period. Norwich, meanwhile, were growing in confidence. Pilkington forced Howard to scramble across his goal to keep out his free-kick and the Toffees keeper was fortunate when he flapped at Whittaker's through-ball but got just enough on it to deny Grant Holt. Holt was involved again when he set up Snodgrass to fire in a shot which was hacked off his line by Johnny Heitinga, while Howard did well to keep out a Pilkington header after being initially wrong-footed. Baines offered Everton some respite, embarking on a dazzling solo run that ended when Ruddy pushed away his shot, and also firing narrowly over from a free-kick. But Norwich continued to press and got their reward right at the end of the game. Baines was penalised for the merest of touches on Morison and Bassong met Garrido's delivery at the back post, his header coming back off the bar and bouncing in, with Holt waiting to knock it over the line if required.  Everton manager David Moyes was unhappy with the decision that led to Norwich's equaliser: "I thought Steve Morison mis-kicked the ball in front of us and I don't think it was a free-kick. "It was a tough game but we should have seen it out and I am disappointed to concede a goal. "We had the opportunities to make it 2-0 but Norwich were always knocking on the door and their form has been very good of late so we knew it was going to be a tough game and it proved to be that. "We played some excellent football in the first half, particularly the first 25 or 30 minutes and maybe we could have capitalised a little bit more. "But we need to turn this good play and opportunities into goals. You can have as many passes and as much possession as you like and play whatever style you like, but the most important thing in foot is to win and that is the most important thing for me."  Norwich boss Chris Hughton: "We know the things we have to do to get points in the Premier League, and games do not get any tougher than having to come to Everton, who are on a really good run. "But we are on a good run ourselves at the moment and where I was delighted today was that, at 1-0 down, we always looked a threat. "The game was very scrappy at times but it is always very pleasing when you score that late. It really is a valuable point for us. "After five or six games we were not doing too well but our form was not actually that bad - we just were not able to pick up the points we would have liked. "The pleasing thing for us now is that there are now points coming with our performance."

24.04.2013 23:34:11 Harry Redknapp watched from the stands as Manchester United came from behind to beat his new Queens Park Rangers side at Old Trafford. QPR, who announced Redknapp as their new boss on Saturday morning, led when Jamie Mackie pounced from close range. Headers from Jonny Evans and Darren Fletcher, on his first league start for over a year, put United in command. Substitute Javier Hernandez stroked in the third as Sir Alex Ferguson's men moved top of the Premier League table. United's three goals in the space of eight second-half minutes puts the pressure firmly back on neighbours Manchester City, who know they can return to the summit by beating Chelsea on Sunday. QPR, who sacked Redknapp's predecessor Mark Hughes on Friday, stay bottom of the table as they remain without a victory in their opening 13 matches. But there will be plenty of positives for Redknapp to take from the match before he assumes control on Monday. Under the guidance of Hughes's former coaches Mark Bowen and Eddie Niedzwiecki, the hard-working visitors refused to allow United any space and used their compact defensive unit as a base to catch their hosts on the break. Scotland international Mackie was the focal point of QPR's counter-attacking raids and he thought he had put them ahead just before the interval when he sent a diving header past United goalkeeper Anders Lindegaard. But the goal was correctly ruled out for offside, with replays showing Mackie had strayed ahead of United central defenders Rio Ferdinand and Evans. It was a laboured performance from the hosts in the opening hour, as Ferguson's side allowed their opponents to score first for the ninth time in 13 top-flight matches this season. A shock looked to be on the cards as Mackie struck after Lindegaard could only parry Kieron Dyer's low cross into his path. United had been rather pedestrian up to the goal and it served to wake them from their slumber as Ferguson urged his players to increase the tempo of their play. Wayne Rooney, back in United's starting XI after missing the last two matches with tonsillitis, pushed further forward alongside Robin van Persie in a bid to stretch a QPR backline that had already conceded 23 goals this season. And it was the England striker who provided the spark for United's recovery. His left-wing corner was met at the far post by Danny Welbeck, whose header allowed Evans, also making his return from injury, to score from virtually on the goal-line. Moments later, Fletcher swung the match in United's favour - again from a Rooney corner. The Scotland international, whose last Premier League appearance came on 19 November 2011 before he missed the rest of the season with a bowel complaint, found space in the QPR box to head in. Hernandez sealed victory as he raced on to a throughball from fellow substitute Anderson, who played a pivotal role after coming on, before confidently slotting past Hoops goalkeeper Julio Cesar.  Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson:  "We only played for 10 minutes and those 10 minutes were brilliant. The crowd got up and I thought Anderson changed the game for us. "We expected an improved performance from QPR, it always happens when a side loses their manager. They fought very hard and had some good counter-attack play. "Falling behind again is a concern but it was a wake up call. Then we got down to our business and played with speed and determination. Victories like this when you're not really at your best are always important. "Darren Fletcher has had a long journey back and he has showed he is back to his best."

24.04.2013 23:34:11 Stoke midfielder Charlie Adam's strike proved the difference in his side's victory over Fulham at the Britannia. Adam latched on to a knock-down from Peter Crouch before scoring with a shot on the turn from six yards. Ryan Shawcross powered a header against the crossbar and Glenn Whelan steered a shot just over for the hosts, who were creating most of the chances. Fulham threatened late on and Dimitar Berbatov had a shot parried away by keeper Asmir Begovic. Stoke also had a Kenwyne Jones effort disallowed for offside and their failure to add to their one-goal lead had left them vulnerably placed the longer the game progressed. The Cottagers, however, stirred themselves into attacking action too late to take advantage of the home side's anxiety. The defeat ended Fulham's run of four away league games without defeat, while the Potters extended a 13-game unbeaten home record in the top flight to move level on points with their visitors. Giant centre-back Brede Hangeland was suspended for Fulham, and a Stoke side sought to expose the Norwegian's absence by testing the visitors in the air. Fulham had an early scare when home defender Robert Huth sent a header just wide from a corner but it was a warning the Martin Jol's side failed to heed. With 26 minutes gone, Ryan Shotton swung in a corner from the right and Crouch, despite the attention of two defenders, nodded down at the far post for Adam, who took a touch before swivelling and shooting in from close range. It was the second goal in three games for the midfielder, who has started to look more like the influential player he was at Blackpool than the inhibited figure at Liverpool last season. Stoke have not lost at the Britannia Stadium since February and, even though Fulham were pretty in possession, they rarely troubled their hosts. The stylish Berbatov has been the visitors' star of the season so far but he struggled to impose himself on the game as Stoke marshalled him into areas where his influence was limited. Stoke carried the threat they are renowned for from set-pieces and Shawcross almost doubled their lead when he beat Cottagers keeper Mark Schwarzer to a Matthew Etherington corner only to see his header come back off the crossbar. Tony Pulis's side were the team creating the chances and, after Fulham failed to deal with another cross, Jon Walters laid the ball to Glenn Whelan, whose 18-yard strike went just over. The home side dropped back in the latter stages of the match and, while Begovic was called into belated action in keeping out a Berbatov shot, Stoke stood firm to secure the three points.  Stoke boss Tony Pulis: "I thought the game should have been out of sight. It was only in the last 10 minutes of it that they came into it. "We got really nervous. Up until then we could have got five or six goals. "I thought we were the better team right up until about the 82nd minute. Although they had a lot of possession it was always back and across, not through us."  Fulham manager Martin Jol: "In the first half, they bully teams and we couldn't get the ball out of our half. "It is their style and I admire their style. It's almost a rugby team. I don't want to talk about the referee, I don't want to look for excuses. "The second half was better and I think that we deserved a point. Stoke is always difficult for us. They have a lot of size and [our centre-back] Brede Hangeland was not there for us."

24.04.2013 23:34:11 Jordi Gomez scored a stoppage-time winner to complete a memorable hat-trick and earn Wigan a dramatic victory over Reading at the DW Stadium. Sean Morrison's first league goal had given the Royals the lead before Gomez levelled after Adam Federici had spilled his initial shot. Gomez headed the hosts 2-1 ahead before Wigan keeper Ali Al Habsi allowed Hal Robson-Kanu's shot to bounce off him into the net to make it 2-2. But Gomez hit the winner from 10 yards. The Spanish midfielder was making his first league start for two months and his treble ensured chairman Dave Whelan celebrated his 76th birthday in style. It brought Wigan's two-match losing run to an end while Reading, who had secured a comeback win over Everton last week, were crestfallen at the end. They will argue they should have had a penalty for a challenge by Latics full-back Maynor Figueroa on Jay Tabb, but Reading's appeals were waved away by referee Howard Webb. Nevertheless Wigan, with several key players absent through injury including skipper Gary Caldwell, were full value for the points. There was no evidence of the drama to come when Latics striker Arouna Kone headed Jean Beausejour's cross wide while unmarked from six yards out. And it looked like being a frustrating afternoon for Kone and his team-mates when the Ivory Coast striker rounded Reading keeper Adam Federici following Gomez's defence-splitting pass only for Nicky Shorey to clear his effort off the line. Having prevented his side from falling behind, Shorey then whipped in a free-kick which allowed Morrison, 21, to head the visitors ahead in the 35th minute. Wigan brought on Franco Di Santo at the start of the second half and the substitute set up Gomez for a 58th-minute equaliser after keeper Federici had failed to hold on to his initial shot. Gomez, who was jeered early in the game for some poor touches, then made it 2-1 with a clever header after meeting Beausejour's cross - but the drama was only just beginning. With time running out, Reading were gifted an equaliser when the usually reliant Al Habsi somehow let Robson-Kanu's speculative effort bounce off him into the net. But the Royals dropped back into the relegation zone after former Barcelona youth player Gomez helped ease Al Habsi's embarrassment by finishing from 10 yards after clever work by Kone deep into stoppage time to the delight of the home support.  Wigan manager Roberto Martinez:  "Nobody deserved a hat-trick more than Jordi. "The crowd were too vocal against him and I hope that they realise that the only thing Jordi does is give his life for Wigan Athletic and to win football games. "I hope we all realise that and he gets a bit of warmth the next time he's on the pitch."  Reading manager Brian McDermott:  "I think if the referee had given the penalty on Jay Tabb we would have gone on to win the game. "Someone of Howard Webb's experience and quality, you would have expected him to get that one right. "But when you're 2-2 in the 92nd minute and we've got the ball, you've got to make sure you see the game out."

24.04.2013 23:34:11 West Brom went third in the Premier League after recording four successive top-flight wins for the first time since 1980 with victory at Sunderland. Zoltan Gera curled them ahead and it was 2-0 by half-time as Simon Mignolet fumbled and Shane Long tapped in. Craig Gardner's free-kick gave the hosts hope before Romelu Lukaku scored West Brom's third from the spot. Stephane Sessegnon converted a rebound late on in a tense finale but Marc-Antoine Fortune sealed it on the break. For all the revelation over West Brom this term, their away form had not been a strong point, with only two wins in 11 league matches on their travels prior to this fixture, but Steve Clarke's side have now proved they are capable of grinding out results. Sunderland have won only once at home this season but had taken renewed confidence from a win at Fulham, their three goals at Craven Cottage equalling their tally in four league matches at the Stadium of Light. In overcast conditions on Wearside they had the better of the early exchanges, Sessegnon the main attacking outlet. The Benin international showed sublime touch to create a shooting opportunity and his effort from the edge of the box was kept out, albeit somewhat awkwardly, by Boaz Myhill diving to his right. Sessegnon tested Myhill again with a close-range header before Gera opened the scoring for the visitors, collecting a pass from Peter Odemwingie and sending a left-foot shot towards the corner that Mignolet got a hand to but could only help into the net. Mignolet's afternoon then got worse when he spilled a seemingly innocuous over-hit through ball from Chris Brunt and Long, following in when others might have given up the chase, dispossessed the keeper for the softest of goals. Sunderland sent on James McClean at the break and made a purposeful start to the second half, but were also vulnerable to the counter-attack, an alert Mignolet needing to advance from his line and clear the danger when Long broke through. Louis Saha was introduced as Sunderland gambled for a way back into the match and fellow substitute Gardner's free-kick deflected into the corner off Marc-Antoine Fortune in the wall to halve the visitors' lead. However, Baggies substitute Lukaku appeared to have made the points safe, calmly sending a left-footed penalty into the bottom corner after Liam Ridgewell fell under a lunging slide from Adam Johnson, although replays suggested little contact had been made. A Sessegnon tap-in after Steven Fletcher's header was parried by Myhill produced a late flicker of hope among home supporters but Fortune settled the contest in added time as the Baggies gave a further demonstration of their attacking prowess this season.  Sunderland manager Martin O'Neill:  "The second goal makes it a tough task but we fought back terrifically and I thought we were going to force the equaliser first time round at 2-2 and of course the penalty decision goes against us. "I was very pleased with the second-half performance, delighted with it. "They're probably as good a counter-attacking side outside the top sides and are up there on merit."

24.04.2013 23:34:11 Joey O'Brien scored his first Premier League goal as West Ham fought back from a limp first-half performance to earn a point against Stoke. The Hammers were fortunate to only trail to Jonathan Walters' stinging drive at the break, with Steven Nzonzi rattling the bar for the visitors. Kevin Nolan went close after the interval before O'Brien steered in Gary O'Neil's low cross from the right. Modibo Maiga almost poked home before Stoke recovered to secure a point. West Ham began the evening in the knowledge that victory would send them into fifth place and mark their best start to a league campaign since 1986. The history that Stoke were attempting to make was more short term - a first away win in the league since beating Blackburn on 2 January. The Potters would have been optimistic of ending their search for three points on the road after comfortably containing West Ham before the interval, but had to settle for just one after being hounded through a barnstorming second half that defied cynics' expectations. Both Sam Allardyce and Tony Pulis have been irritated by attempts to characterise their teams' style as uncomplicated and direct but neither did much to dispel that impression early on. Stoke's attempts to send long balls towards the head of Peter Crouch proved more promising than West Ham's crosses towards Andy Carroll at the opposite end. Charlie Adam shanked a volley over the top from a knock-down before Crouch himself could only direct a tame nod into the gloves of Jussi Jaaskelainen. A reputation for well-worked set-piece routines is something that Pulis has been happier to earn and a perfectly executed training-ground move delivered the opener. With their attention drawn by Crouch and Ryan Shawcross's runs to the near post, the Hammers defenders failed to track Walters who appeared in a pocket of space to swipe home Glenn Whelan's precise corner. Reverting to a more patient build-up, West Ham had glimpses of goal - Mohamed Diame missing his kick after a cute backheel from Kevin Nolan before the skipper himself fired straight at Asmir Begovic - but Stoke finished in the ascendancy with Nzonzi crashing a half-volley against the bar. Stoke emerged early for the second half, but West Ham swarmed all over them from the first whistle. Nolan had already failed to apply a telling touch from two yards when O'Brien stole in front of Shawcross to stab O'Neil's low cross into the roof of the net. The Stoke rearguard was flustered and was almost breached again soon after as Maiga side-footed against the legs of Begovic from Carroll's knockdown. With his side reeling, Pulis introduced Wilson Palacios at the expense of Whelan to apply the brakes to a rampant West Ham. The switch, combined with some streetwise delays over goalkicks, succeeded in stabilising the visitors and drawing the sting from the hosts' attacks out wide. West Ham were unable to rediscover the penetration over the final quarter as Stoke dug in and defended stoutly to close out the game.  West Ham boss Sam Allardyce: "I thought we deserved three points in the end. "Stoke were slightly better than us in the first half and we had to recover from what was an extremely good goal. "Having to come from 1-0 down in any game in the Premier League is difficult. "It's another point on the board, we move on reasonably happy. "Andy Carroll is not to be frustrated by the fact that he is not scoring at the moment and in fact today he didn't get much of a chance to score. "He wants to score a goal and he wants me to leave him on for 90 minutes but at the end of the day he put that much effort in, there are a lot of fresh players on the bench."  Stoke boss Tony Pulis: "First half I thought we played well and created the better opportunities and really we needed that second goal. "The worst thing that happened to us was half-time. That took the momentum away from us. "We started very sloppy in the second half, we invited West Ham onto us and they scored a goal and from that point onwards we need to show a lot of resilience and determination. "We have worked on it for the past three days, we tried it five or six times and Jonathan Walters has never scored from it so I'm glad he saved it for today. "All of my career I have always looked for little angles and little areas that we could exploit from set-plays and it is lovely when it comes off."

24.04.2013 23:34:11 Manchester City reduced Manchester United's lead at the top of the Premier League to 12 points as they restored pride with an impressive victory at Old Trafford. The reigning champions may have left it too late to prevent United claiming the title for the 20th time - but this deserved win hints at the pedigree that remains within Roberto Mancini's squad. Substitute Sergio Aguero's brilliant winner 12 minutes from time gave City their second successive victory at Old Trafford, one which will hurt United boss Sir Alex Ferguson, who saw his side produce a subdued performance. James Milner gave the visitors the lead early in the second half before an own goal from City captain Vincent Kompany put United level. The final word, however, went to Aguero, who demonstrated pace and a powerful finish to decide an occasionally ill-tempered derby which saw eight players cautioned. United still have much room for manoeuvre with the commanding advantage at the top of the Premier League, but this was a composed, resilient performance from City that demonstrated what might have been. Mancini has insisted the gap between the sides is not as wide as their points deficit suggests and on this evidence he is right. The Italian's argument, however, falls down on grounds of consistency as this was United first loss in 18 league games. Wayne Rooney was back in United's attack after recovering from the groin injury that kept him out of the FA Cup defeat at Chelsea. He was fired up and visibly furious with team-mate Danny Welbeck in the opening minutes when he selfishly chose to go alone with his team-mate unmarked in yards of space. Phil Jones was alongside Rio Ferdinand in central defence and he showed his worth with a couple of crucial penalty area interceptions, most notably from Carlos Tevez as the former United striker closed in six yards out. City were seeing plenty of the ball but neither side was able to create any clear-cut chances, although Rafael's looping effort bounced to safety off the angle of post and bar moments before half-time. In among some heated exchanges, Rooney was booked for a two-footed lunge at Milner while Kompany was also given a yellow card from referee Mike Dean for a late challenge on Ashley Young. City took the lead they just about deserved six minutes after the break - and it resulted from a rare error of judgement from veteran Ryan Giggs, whose needless back heel gifted possession to Gareth Barry. He found Samir Nasri before Milner's low 20-yard drive took a touch off Jones to beat David de Gea. Jones was involved as the hosts drew level eight minutes later. He met Robin van Persie's vicious inswinging free-kick and his header ricocheted in off the back of Kompany in front of an elated Stretford End. Mancini made his first change with 20 minutes left, introducing fit-again Aguero for Samir Nasri - and the Argentine demonstrated his brilliance to put City back in front. He produced a burst of pace, something City had lacked, inside the area before flashing an angled drive high past De Gea. It set up an angry rather than grandstand finish, with players from both sides involved in exchanges after Aguero and Ferdinand squared up when United did not put the ball out of play with David Silva down injured. Young then limped off injured after a heavy Pablo Zabaleta challenge before referee Dean brought a frenetic evening to a close.

24.04.2013 23:34:11 Sunderland produced a rousing second-half display to record only their second Premier League victory of the season at the expense of 10-man Fulham. The dismissal of Brede Hangeland after 30 minutes proved the turning point. Steven Fletcher poked in to put Sunderland ahead just after half-time, only for Fulham to level as substitute Mladen Petric netted from close range. But Sunderland hit back through Carlos Cuellar and a spectacular strike from Stephane Sessegnon to seal victory. This was a vital win for Martin O'Neill's side. The pressure had begun to grow after a run of just one victory in 18 Premier League matches. But if the supporters had been restless before kick-off, all that was forgotten at the final whistle as Sunderland's travelling support celebrated their first away win in the league since February. The opening 45 minutes had been a demonstration of why the Black Cats have struggled so badly in recent times. O'Neill's side lacked cohesion, confidence and sustained threat; they were insipid not inventive. While they desperately needed tempo, they produced only tedium. For the opening half-hour, Fulham dictated play with Dimitar Berbatov in the thick of the action, heading one chance over after four minutes and conjuring up another for Steve Sidwell, only for the midfielder to shoot tamely at Sunderland goalkeeper Simon Mignolet. But then came the afternoon's defining moment as Hangeland was sent off for a two-footed challenge on Lee Cattermole. Referee Lee Probert produced a red card almost immediately - although the actual contact with the Sunderland man was minimal, the challenge was reckless at best. It was an opportunity for Sunderland, but for the remainder of the half they played like a side burdened by a new sense of expectation. This was a chance they simply could not afford to pass up. To their credit, O'Neill's side emerged from the interval with more intent and a move more incisive than anything they had managed before the break produced the opening goal. The visitors' breakthrough actually came from Fulham's best chance of the match, as John Arne Riise's deflected shot rebounded from the underside of the crossbar and set Sunderland in motion. Adam Johnson raced away down the left, before curling a delightful pass into the path of Fletcher at the edge of the box. His first touch controlled the ball, his second nudged it beyond Fulham goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer and into the net. Fulham's troubles increased moments later when Bryan Ruiz, having tweaked his hamstring, limped off to be replaced by Petric. Sunderland immediately sought to press home their advantage and were only denied by Schwarzer, who threw himself low to his right to tip Johnson's curling shot to safety. And yet the home support roused their side, as Damien Duff surged forward, took advantage of a fortunate deflection off Hugo Rodallega, and squared the ball for Petric to fire in from six yards. But crucially the Croatian striker injured himself in the act of scoring and, with Fulham briefly reduced to nine men, Sunderland struck again. Johnson's left-wing corner was met by Cuellar, who rose above Sidwell to head firmly beyond Schwarzer. Five minutes later, Sunderland added a third following another swift counter-attack. This time Johnson fed Sessegnon whose fierce curling shot found the corner of the net from 25 yards. The final whistle was greeted with a pump of the fist by O'Neill. The Sunderland manager's relief was palpable.

24.04.2013 23:34:11 Norwich recorded only their second win over Manchester United in 15 league matches thanks to a brilliant headed goal from Anthony Pilkington. The ex-Huddersfield forward struck 30 minutes from time when he flicked in Javier Garrido's cross from the left. United, who had been usurped at the top of the table by rivals City coming into the game, looked well below their best. Ashley Young's shot was saved by John Ruddy, who also tipped over a header from his own player Sebastien Bassong. The England goalkeeper would have expected a busier evening, but both he and his team witnessed a flat performance from the visitors. Although the 19-time champions have bounced back from such setbacks many times, what might be of concern to manager Sir Alex Ferguson is their lack of creativity from midfield, particularly from the centre. In a flat 4-4-2, Ryan Giggs was ineffective, bar one deft ball over the top. And bringing on Paul Scholes, who turned 38 this week, was a clear sign of their lack of depth in this area. Nonetheless, they came into the fixture in good form, with nine wins from their previous 10 league fixtures. But Norwich, who had kept three clean sheets in their last four league outings, were certainly not going to lie down. While another shutout seemed a step too far for the Canaries against a trigger-happy strikeforce of Robin van Persie and Javier Hernandez, the home defence showed that their recent improvement was no flash in the pan. Norwich manager Chris Hughton mentioned prior to the match that fielding the same centre-back pairing in recent weeks had helped his side's performances and neither Bassong nor Michael Turner let him down. Turner was particularly impressive, consistently getting in front of his man Hernandez to clear. In fact, during that first half United managed to get behind the Canaries backline only on a handful of occasions - and only once did they give the home side the jitters. That chance for last season's runners-up was conjured up shortly before half-time when Giggs floated a pass into the area which Van Persie allowed to drop over his shoulder. But the Netherlands international made a mess of his footwork, much to the amusement of the home support. Norwich created the best opportunities during the opening period with former Leeds forward Robert Snodgrass flicking a header a fraction wide before narrowly failing to get a connection on Pilkington's driven cross. The Canaries seemed to have the freedom of the wings to cross the ball into the United area, although rarely did they pose problems for Chris Smalling and Rio Ferdinand - that was until the 60th minute. Spaniard Garrido, on loan from Lazio, once again took advantage of the space afforded to his side out wide and delivered a flat-flighted ball into the area which Pilkington beautifully guided past the reach of Anders Lindegaard. It was 11th time in 18 matches that United had fallen behind this season - but they had won 15 points in the league having been in losing positions. Ferguson brought on forward Danny Welbeck, who scored for England in midweek, and veteran Scholes with 20 minutes remaining. Welbeck threatened on a couple of occasions, but the closest the visitors came to escaping with a point in the closing stages was when Bassong inadvertently forced Ruddy to tip his header over the bar. Late in the game, Jonny Howson had a chance to add a second for Norwich, but he messed up his lines after being put clean through. Luckily for him there was no late heartache for his team, who climb to 13th in the table.

24.04.2013 23:34:11 Luis Suarez produced another virtuoso display as Liverpool cruised to victory over Wigan and recorded an overdue second home league win of the season. The Uruguayan scored twice as Liverpool turned on the style during a rampant second-half performance to extend their unbeaten run to seven matches. Jose Enrique added a third but this was Suarez's day. After moving to the top of the Premier League scoring charts with his ninth and 10th goals of the season, he left the field to a standing ovation five minutes from time. Wigan offered little after a promising opening 45 minutes and suffered a further setback when it emerged Ben Watson had broken his leg after an innocuous first-half challenge with Raheem Sterling. The 17-year-old England winger was a key factor in Liverpool's resurgence, as was an energetic performance from substitute Jordan Henderson. The performances of those players allowed Reds boss Brendan Rodgers to deny that Suarez is carrying his side this season but having accounted for 10 of Liverpool's 17 league goals this campaign, he appears to be thriving on the responsibility. The striker, though, could face scrutiny for the wrong reasons after Wigan manager Roberto Martinez accused him of stamping on Latics midfielder David Jones. Convincing home wins have been collectors' items for Liverpool in 2012, with league games at Anfield becoming a test of patience for the fans. For 45 minutes it seemed this game would go the same way. Chances came and went, while the groans and jeers of frustration built in the stands along with a familiar sense of unease. Liverpool chairman Tom Werner, making a rare appearance in the Anfield directors' box, may well have had a sense of deja vu as he watched Rodgers' side zip the ball around without ever really troubling the visitors. After 36 minutes, Rodgers had seen enough and replaced Suso with Henderson in order to push Steven Gerrard into a more advanced role. The possession football played by both sides was full of pretty patterns but devoid of penetration. Liverpool went into the break having only tested Wigan goalkeeper Ali Al-Habsi twice, through Suso's rasping left-foot shot and a Daniel Agger header. But, having done so well, Wigan fell apart in 20 second-half minutes. If the individual brilliance of Suarez and Sterling had been absent before the break it was certainly in evidence within two minutes of the restart. A poorly placed pass by Jean Beausejour set Sterling racing onto the loose ball. The England winger skipped beyond Maynor Figueroa and paused before picking out Suarez with a composed and clever cut-back that the Uruguayan sent high into the net. It was a goal that simultaneously relieved the growing tension and energised this struggling Liverpool side. The red shirts were pouring forward now, chasing lost causes and snapping into every tackle. Enrique, pushed into a more advanced role down the left, was at the forefront of the resurgence and it was the Spaniard who created a second goal 11 minutes after the first with a precise through ball for Suarez. The striker bent his run between the Wigan defenders and nipped in before Al-Habsi to poke the ball past him into the net. Chasing a hat-trick, the Uruguayan was involved in everything now and twice more went close before playing his part in Liverpool's third goal. He exchanged passes with 17-year-old Sterling, whose shot was parried by Al-Habsi allowing Enrique to poke in. Gary Caldwell was booked as Wigan expressed their fury at the way the goal came about having seen a throw-in that should have gone their way awarded to Liverpool. Martinez would later claim that Suarez was the main difference between the sides, but in the end Liverpool won at a canter.

24.04.2013 23:34:11 Sergio Aguero and Carlos Tevez both scored twice as Manchester City thumped Aston Villa to move top of the Premier League for the first time this season. Villa frustrated City until David Silva broke the deadlock before half-time. But the hosts took charge when Andreas Weimann was adjudged to have handled and Sergio Aguero scored from the spot. Carlos Tevez added another penalty after Barry Bannan's handball, Aguero made it 4-0 with a deflected shot and Tevez tapped in Samir Nasri's cross. Manchester United's shock defeat at Norwich later on Saturday meant City stayed at the summit. The size of Villa's defeat, together with Reading's victory over Everton, leaves them in the relegation zone. In the end, this win for the champions was every bit as convincing as the scoreline suggests but Villa boss Paul Lambert will argue his side were in the game until the 54th minute, when City scored their second goal from a debatable decision. Referee Jon Moss pointed to the spot after his assistant Adrian Holmes spotted a near-post handball by Weimann from Silva's corner, but replays showed Weimann made no contact and none of City's players appealed for a penalty. Once Aguero scored to give them breathing space, the champions did not look back - and could have had more goals if Scott Sinclair had been more ruthless after coming off the bench. The result leaves Roberto Mancini's men - the only unbeaten side in the division - above their neighbours, having conceded the fewest league goals and with the best goal difference. They did not have things all their own way against Villa, however, the visitors frustrating them before half-time and also creating some decent chances themselves. First Joe Hart had to react quickly to keep out Vincent Kompany's attempted clearance from Matthew Lowton's cross. And the City keeper, under renewed scrutiny following his unconvincing performance for England against Sweden on Wednesday, came to his side's rescue again when he dived to keep out Christian Benteke's bouncing header. City, meanwhile, were seeing far more of the ball but were unable to break down Villa's determined defence. Tevez and Yaya Toure were reduced to shooting from distance and Mancini might have been contemplating an early introduction of Edin Dzeko, who again started on the bench despite last week's heroics against Tottenham. But there was no need for a super-sub on this occasion. City forced Brad Guzan into his first save of note just before the break, when he tipped Tevez's skidding effort round his post. And Villa's resistance was broken from the resulting corner, with Kompany knocking the ball goalwards from Nasri's delivery and Silva darting in to fire over the line from close range for his first goal of the season. More was to follow after half-time, but only after Holmes's decision, which Weimann continued to dispute as he was substituted and then again at the final whistle. City's second penalty was more clear-cut, Bannan handling the ball while he was on the ground as Silva went round him in the area. This time Tevez was given the responsibility from the spot and he sent Guzan the wrong way. By now City were rampant and Villa's earlier organisation nowhere to be seen. Aguero got his second when his shot took a touch off Enda Stevens and beat Guzan at his near post. And Tevez made it 5-0 from close range after Nasri's ball reached him at the far post.

24.04.2013 23:34:11 Michu and Jonathan de Guzman were on target as Swansea secured their second away victory of the season and their first win over Newcastle in 32 years. Pablo Hernandez capitalised on home goalkeeper Tim Krul's poor clearance on 58 minutes to set up Michu's opener. With three minutes remaining, De Guzman doubled Swansea's lead from close range after Krul denied Danny Graham. Demba Ba's stoppage-time header proved little consolation for Newcastle, who lost their second successive home game. Newcastle were dealt a blow before kick-off with Senegal invoking Fifa's five-day rule to prevent striker Papiss Cisse from playing, and replacement Sammy Ameobi was one of three changes to the home side's line-up. For Swansea, on-loan striker Itay Shechter was given a first Premier League start in place of the injured Ki Sung-Yueng while Nathan Dyer was preferred to former Newcastle player Wayne Routledge. Dyer, who scored last week at Southampton, found himself through on goal early on after being played in by Shechter but under pressure from Steven Taylor the winger shot harmlessly wide. Both sides showed plenty of promise during a lively opening at St James' Park with Hernandez firing straight at home keeper Tim Krul before Newcastle's Hatem Ben Arfa slammed a shot into the side-netting after linking up well with Danny Simpson. Krul made a low save to parry Michu's effort from outside the area, while at the other end captain Taylor headed over the crossbar from Vurnon Anita's corner. The home side were beginning to force their way into the game and from Ben Arfa's excellent delivery from the right, Demba Ba got in between Ashley Williams and Garry Monk but glanced a header wide from 10 yards. Ben Arfa was seeing plenty of the ball and the France international tricked his way past two players on the edge of the area before curling in a dipping effort that forced Gerhard Tremmel into a fine one-handed save. But Swansea were looking impressive on the counter-attack and Shechter capitalised on hesitation in the Newcastle defence to force a save from Krul before Michu dragged his shot wide as the half ended goalless. The hosts began the second half brightly with the Ameobi brothers - Sammy and half-time substitute Shola - combining to tee up Anita, who fired over from 25 yards, while Ba also had two chances in quick succession. Having survived those scares, Swansea responded on the counter-attack and Shechter should have done better when he received the ball from Hernandez and fired wide from 15 yards. Krul also had to turn a Hernandez shot around the post. But the visitors did not have to wait too long for the game's opening goal and it was the Newcastle keeper who was to blame. Krul's poor clearance from Mike Williamson's back pass fell to Hernandez, whose cross from the left found the advancing Michu to head home his eighth goal of the season. Rather than sit back Swansea continued to push forward and Michu should have added a second but the Spaniard scuffed his shot from close range following Hernandez's cross. Swansea wrapped up the victory three minutes from time when Krul could only parry substitute Graham's shot and De Guzman netted the rebound. Ba's stoppage-time header, after substitute Sylvain Marveaux had struck the bar, was little consolation for Alan Pardew's side, who have now won only one of their last 10 league games.

24.04.2013 23:34:11 Southampton piled the pressure on Queens Park Rangers manager Mark Hughes, producing an outstanding performance to win deservedly at Loftus Road. Hughes and his opposite number Nigel Adkins were under such scrutiny before kick-off that this meeting of the Premier League strugglers was dubbed "El Sackico" on the basis that the loser would be lucky to keep his job. And while Saints boss Adkins took the acclaim of the 3,000 travelling supporters at the final whistle, Hughes - whose side remain without a league win and are five points adrift - was subjected to the full fury of the QPR fans. Rickie Lambert and Jason Puncheon put Southampton in control at half-time and even though Junior Hoilett pulled a goal back for QPR, Anton Ferdinand's late own goal gave Adkins his first away points of the season and an outstanding victory. Hughes has been singing a familiar refrain throughout QPR's wretched start to the season, claiming performances have not reaped the rewards they deserved. But that was not the case this time. QPR were dismal and their supporters vented their feelings, chanting for Hughes's dismissal. One group of fans asked for the appointment of former Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp by brandishing a banner reading: "Harry Come and Save Us". Owner Tony Fernandes has constantly delivered public support for Hughes but this was a performance and situation that will have tested even his patience. Adkins, however, can bask in a superb Southampton show that was a mirror of his own positive, confident approach. His team's game plan was exemplified in the opening moments when Adam Lallana volleyed just over and Puncheon's angled cross bounced away to safety with QPR keeper Julio Cesar beaten. QPR's threat was fleeting, with Adel Taarabt weaving his way to force a save from Paulo Gazzaniga, who was then fortunate when he fumbled Hoilett's shot just wide. The goal which Saints deserved came after 23 minutes when Lambert dived bravely among flying boots in the six-yard area to head in after Puncheon's shot had been turned away by Jose Bosingwa. QPR's supporters were becoming increasingly agitated and the atmosphere was soon even more hostile moments before half-time when Puncheon cut in from the right and fired a low 25-yard shot beyond Cesar. It was the signal for a furious reaction around Loftus Road as referee Mike Dean ended the half for Hughes and his men. The manager responded by sending on Jamie Mackie at the break and a sense of urgency was rewarded after 49 minutes when Hoilett flicked Taarabt's cross over Gazzaniga, who had looked the weak link in Saints' performance. The goal gave QPR impetus but Southampton were still dangerous. Puncheon dragged a good chance wide from Lambert's knockdown and was then unfortunate to see a superb angled effort on the turn from 25 yards fly inches wide. Puncheon was in the mood to shoot on sight and another effort was turned away for a corner by Cesar as Southampton continued to play to their attacking strengths. While QPR's performance had improved marginally after the break - it could hardly have got worse - the Saints were still pressing for a third goal and Cesar again had to save well from Maya Yoshida's acrobatic attempt. Southampton's victory was sealed seven minutes from time when Morgan Schneiderlin, given too much time and space to cross following a corner, sent in a low centre which was deflected into his own net at the near post by Ferdinand.

24.04.2013 23:34:11 Adam Le Fondre earned struggling Reading their first Premier League win of the season with both goals in a battling comeback victory over Everton. The visitors dominated the first half, Steven Naismith stabbing his side ahead, before Phil Jagielka's header was cleared off the line. But Reading stormed back with Le Fondre equalising through a glancing header from Nicky Shorey's free-kick. Le Fondre won it with a late penalty after being fouled by Seamus Coleman. At the end of an absorbing contest there were scenes of both joy and relief at the Madejski Stadium, with Reading's Russian owner Anton Zingarevich punching the air in delight. The Royals' first top-flight victory since May 2008 was richly deserved, and came against an Everton side which had lost only one of their last 20 league games. But the Toffees, who had more than half of their team playing in midweek internationals, simply ran out of steam. Despite their flying start to the season, which had taken them to fourth in the table, David Moyes's men had fallen behind in their previous six league games. Yet they started brightly in Berkshire as Phil Jagielka, stand-in captain after Phil Neville underwent a knee operation, was denied by keeper Adam Federici following a corner by Thomas Hitzlsperger, making his first league start since joining the club last month. Nikica Jelavic then wasted another chance, volleying into the ground from close range, before Everton took the lead in the 10th minute. Having kept their first Premier League clean sheet of the season in the previous game at Norwich, Reading's defence was guilty of a comedy of errors which allowed Jelavic and Marouane Fellaini to combine for Naismith to stab home from close range. Everton should have gone on to secure all three points before half-time. Steven Pienaar went close to doubling the lead after a mistake by Chris Gunter, before the busy Hitzlsperger stung the fingertips of Federici, who then did well to keep out new England cap Leon Osman. Apart from one moment when Tim Howard was beaten to a long punt forward by Le Fondre, Everton were largely untroubled before the break. Moyes's side were denied a penalty when Sean Morrison appeared to handle Jelavic's goalbound shot before Jay Tabb cleared off the line from Jagielka on the stroke of half-time. But Everton, who blew a lead in their previous away game, did so again when they allowed Le Fondre to head past Howard following Shorey's curling 51st minute free-kick. And, after being needlessly bundled over by Coleman with 11 minutes remaining, Le Fondre picked himself up to send Howard the wrong way from the spot.

24.04.2013 23:34:12 Chelsea went a fourth league game without a win as they were beaten by the top flight's surprise package West Brom at The Hawthorns. The Baggies went in front through striker Shane Long's stooping header. Eden Hazard nodded Chelsea level but West Brom regained the lead when Peter Odemwingie headed in Long's cross. Chelsea were denied a spot-kick for Claudio Yacob's shove on Victor Moses and Daniel Sturridge failed to take two late chances as the Baggies held on. Sturridge raced through on goal only to have his shot saved by Baggies keeper Boaz Myhill before he had an angled shot across goal go wide. The visitors' second-half pressure was almost incessant but not enough to bring them a point, while victory moved the bouncing Baggies - managed by ex-Chelsea player and assistant manager Steve Clarke - up to fourth place and just a point behind Chelsea. It was West Brom's sixth home league win in seven games this season. Albion also beat Chelsea at The Hawthorns last season, a defeat that resulted in Andre Villas-Boas being sacked as Blues boss and former Baggies boss Roberto Di Matteo taking over. Di Matteo went on to taste Champions League and FA Cup glory so he might have had a degree of satisfaction in returning to the club who dismissed him as manager in February 2010. That did not last long, however, as his risky move in making five changes with Tuesday's crucial Champions League game at Juventus in mind backfired. Chelsea had gone close early on when Sturridge and Moses combined to set up Ryan Bertrand for a shot that was cleared off the line by Liam Ridgewell. Hazard pounced on the loose ball and his shot might have produced a penalty as it appeared to strike defender Jonas Olsson's arm. But referee Michael Oliver did not award a spot-kick and the Baggies capitalised by taking the lead themselves, Zoltan Gera slipping the ball to James Morrison, whose cross to the far post was headed in by Long. The visitors struggled to get back on level terms as West Brom, who blended a tigerish work-rate with an assured passing game, showed why they have made their best start to a season in 30 years. Chelsea, though, kept probing and Hazard equalised when he met Cesar Azpilicueta's cross with a far-post header that took a touch off right-back Billy Jones on the way in. The Blues appeared to have seized the impetus but, after Sturridge had a shot on the turn saved by Myhill, the visitors again fell behind. This time Long was the provider as he whipped in a cross for Odemwingie, whose glancing header went in through the legs of keeper Petr Cech. Di Matteo was forced to throw on Oscar and Juan Mata for Oriol Romeu and the ineffective Fernando Torres, and the move almost immediately worked. Moses was denied a penalty for a shove by Yacob before Mata's chipped ball found Sturridge, only for his flicked shot to be instinctively saved by Myhill. Myhill was developing into one of Albion's star performers and he again came to his side's rescue when he saved another Sturridge effort. Sturridge has pushed his claims for a starting place but he did not help his cause as he failed to take the opportunities that came his way. He had a clear sight of goal in the final minutes of the match only to drag his effort wide as another Chelsea chance went begging.

24.04.2013 23:34:12 Arsenal benefited from Emmanuel Adebayor's sending off to secure a comeback victory over Tottenham and move above them in the Premier League. Adebayor tapped Spurs in front against his old club but was dismissed for a high and late tackle on Santi Cazorla. Per Mertesacker headed the hosts level then Lukas Podolski and Olivier Giroud struck before half-time. Cazorla slotted in and although Gareth Bale drilled home to pull one back, Theo Walcott sealed the points late on. Arsenal's first league win since 27 October, courtesy of an identical scoreline to last season's corresponding fixture, takes them up to sixth in the table. While they have still only suffered one home defeat by Spurs in 19 years, this was not as convincing a victory as the scoreline suggests. Spurs looked in control before Adebayor's red card, a moment of madness that may have contributed to a third straight league defeat. Boss Andre Villas-Boas said Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy spent all week telling him how vital it was to win at Emirates Stadium. That message was heeded by his players early on, the decision to start two strikers in a 4-4-2 formation paying off. Adebayor and Jermain Defoe were causing Arsenal's defence all sorts of problems and moments after William Gallas had seen a strike ruled out for offside, Spurs were ahead. Mertesacker and Sagna both inexplicably stepped up to let Vertonghen's long ball send Defoe clean through. His low drive from the left was repelled by Wojciech Szczesny - starting his first match in two months following an ankle injury - but Adebayor was on hand to tap home the rebound. Arsenal were struggling for any sort of rhythm and Aaron Lennon dragged an effort inches wide as Tottenham pressed for a second. However, the momentum shifted when Adebayor caught Cazorla with a lunging raised foot, leaving referee Howard Webb little option. The dismissal of a player who left Arsenal for Manchester City before joining Tottenham gave the home players and fans a noticeable lift. Six minutes later, Mertesacker peeled away from Gallas to meet Walcott's right-wing cross with a superb header. Hugo Lloris, making only his second league start in goal in place of Brad Friedel, could do nothing to stop the equaliser and prevented a second when Giroud glanced Wilshere's free-kick towards the top corner. The pressure began to mount, though, and after Cazorla swerved a drive just over and Lloris again denied Giroud, Arsenal went ahead. A neat interchange between Mikel Arteta and Wilshere set up Podolski and his finish bobbled into the net via Gallas. It was now a case of damage limitation until the break for Tottenham, but they were breached once more in stoppage time. Webb played an advantage that enabled Cazorla to supply a low cross from the left for Giroud to sweep home first time, despite Gallas and Vertonghen being in close attendance. Villas-Boas replaced full-backs Kyle Walker and Kyle Naughton with centre-back Michael Dawson and forward Clint Dempsey - switching to 3-5-1 - and his team started the second half with tempo. But Arsenal used their numerical advantage to avert the danger before targeting their opponents on the counter-attack. The tactic was rewarded when Walcott fed Podolski on the left and his perfectly-weighted centre was easily converted by Cazorla. Bale showed there was still life in Tottenham, exploiting lax defending to find the bottom corner before going just wide three minutes later. Arsenal had a two-goal cushion but looked nervous, and Defoe somehow failed to connect with a Bale corner from close range. But as Spurs began to tire, Gunners boss Arsene Wenger introduced Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and he set up Walcott to complete the win.

24.04.2013 23:34:12 Chelsea failed to close the gap on Premier League leaders Manchester United as Luis Suarez's equaliser gave Liverpool a point at Stamford Bridge. Captain John Terry headed the Blues an early lead but was then taken off on a stretcher after appearing to sustain a serious knee injury in an accidental first-half collision with Suarez. Oscar and Juan Mata were guilty of missing clear chances to emphasise Chelsea's obvious superiority and, with 18 minutes remaining, Roberto Di Matteo's side paid the price when Suarez headed in his 11th goal of the season after Jamie Carragher flicked on Suso's corner. Suarez was on target for the fourth successive away league game - further illustrating his vital importance to a Liverpool team that enjoys plenty of possession but, apart from the Uruguayan, carries too little threat. For Chelsea, this was a disappointment that leaves them three points adrift of United and fearing that influential captain Terry could now be facing a lengthy spell on the sidelines. Liverpool reverted to a five-man defensive system to counter Chelsea's attacking threat but were almost undone as early as the fifth minute when Oscar burst clear into the area only to send his effort off target with only keeper Brad Jones to beat. It set the tone for early Chelsea domination and Terry - back in Premier League action after a four-match suspension - took advantage of sloppy Liverpool defending to give them the lead after 20 minutes, escaping easily from Daniel Agger to flash a near-post header beyond Jones. Fernando Torres had started in sprightly mood against his former club and forced a block out of Jones after an exchange with Eden Hazard, who then sent the rebound wide. Having experienced the joy of scoring, Terry was taken off in agony before half-time after his coming together with Suarez. Chelsea were still in the ascendancy as the break approached and Mata should have doubled their lead in stoppage time but shot high and wide with Jones once again the only obstacle. Torres's endeavour demonstrated how desperate he was to hit the target and he almost got his wish with a header that was parried away by Jones. Liverpool, thanks to Chelsea's profligacy, had been able to stay in range and were back in business in the 73rd minute thanks to Suarez, who headed in from virtually on the line. Suddenly the visitors had some impetus. Suarez attempted to surprise Petr Cech with an audacious long-range effort then narrowly lost out to the keeper in a race for Jose Enrique's through ball. Chelsea were also pressing and Branislav Ivanovic was not far away with a header as the game opened up in the closing phase. The last chance fell to Enrique but he could not force his shot past Cech from an angle in the final seconds.  Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers:  "We are disappointed with the goal. It was quite a standard corner ball into the box and we lost our man. But once again we showed the character in the team. "In the first half we were too slow to get the ball forward. In the second half the players were fantastic. Their confidence and belief returned. "All credit goes to the players. The equaliser was the least we deserved. We were probably unfortunate not to win it at the end."

24.04.2013 23:34:12 Shaun Maloney's 94th-minute free-kick earned struggling Wigan a point and denied 10-man QPR what would have been a vital win at the bottom of the table. Loic Remy hit the post early on but Rangers had to play for 70 minutes with 10 men after Bobby Zamora was sent off for a high challenge on Jordi Gomez. Wigan struggled to make their extra man count and QPR thought they had won it through Remy's superb breakaway goal. But Maloney replied in injury time with a curling shot into the top corner. It was a cruel climax to another frustrating day for QPR boss Harry Redknapp, who had described this game as a 'must-win' before kick-off and came within seconds of collecting what would have been an unlikely three points. Wigan, looking a shadow of the side who had won their previous three matches, barely deserved the draw, but it means they are only in the relegation zone on goal difference, behind Sunderland. QPR, meanwhile, remain in deep trouble, only one place below the Latics but seven points further back, and with only six games to save themselves. It appeared the Rangers players had responded to their manager's pre-match pledge that only victory would do against their relegation rivals as they made a bright start. Junior Hoilett knocked down an Andros Townsend cross for Remy, who had time to shape himself on the edge of the box and fire in a dipping first-time shot that cannoned back off the post. While Rangers were direct, the Latics were patient, but they did not look much of a threat until Zamora's untimely exit after 20 minutes. Zamora, who was late and high when he clattered his boot into Gomez's head from a Wigan throw, disputed the decision, which came after referee Phil Dowd had a lengthy discussion with his assistant Scott Ledger, but TV replays showed the officials had little option but to dismiss him. The extra man allowed the Latics to step up their passing game and they began to threaten at last. QPR keeper Julio Cesar, who had injured his elbow in the warm-up, might have expected an onslaught but some determined defending meant he only had to face shots from distance. Callum McManaman curled one effort over and drilled another narrowly wide and, when the visitors did find the target, Cesar scrambled to his left to keep out a skidding James McCarthy effort. Wigan continued to toil in attack after the break, and it took until the 76th minute for them to force Cesar into his next save. It was a good one too, with the Brazilian keeping out James McArthur's header at point-blank range. More pressure from the Latics followed, but it was from a free-kick on the edge of the Rangers box that the home side took the lead with five minutes to go. Mbia surged forward after an over-elaborate set-piece was blocked and almost reached the edge of the Wigan area before finding Remy to his right, for the Frenchman to sidefoot an unstoppable first-time shot past Wigan keeper Joel Robles. The Latics, who have climbed up the table on the back of two straight league wins after beating Everton in the FA Cup, responded by piling men forward and eventually QPR cracked. Mbia fouled Maloney on the edge of the area and he stepped up to bend the ball through the wall and past the diving Cesar.

24.04.2013 23:34:12 Kevin Nolan's first-half goal against his former club proved enough to see off a lacklustre Newcastle and propel West Ham into the top six. Nolan ghosted in at the far post to turn in Joey O'Brien's mis-hit shot. Newcastle were denied an equaliser when the officials ruled that goalkeeper Jussi Jaaskelainen had prevented Demba Ba's header from crossing the line. Former Magpie Andy Carroll could have given West Ham breathing space but Tim Krul pulled off a fine one-handed save. The home side's performance was so lacking in precision or passion that a 2-0 scoreline would hardly have flattered the upwardly mobile Hammers. And the result will bring immense satisfaction to West Ham boss Sam Allardyce, who last week described his sacking by the Magpies after 24 games in 2008 as one of the lowest points in his career. In their first season back in the Premier League, the Hammers were comfortable victors - despite losing three players to injury - and, in the tireless Nolan, had comfortably the best player on the pitch. Indeed, Newcastle boss Alan Pardew's pre-match suggestion that he would welcome Nolan and Carroll back to St James' Park looked entirely justified in a blunt attacking display in which striker Papiss Cisse and his half-time replacement Shola Ameobi were particularly ineffective. An opening 30 minutes low on quality and goalmouth action was characterised by misplaced passes and mistimed challenges. Both sides were forced into an early change. First, Newcastle captain Jonas Gutierrez came off worst in a 50-50 tackle with Yossi Benayoun, then West Ham winger Matt Jarvis made way for Mali forward Modibo Maiga. Carroll, whose every touch for Liverpool was booed when the sides met in April, received a noticeably less hostile reception from the fans who used to revere him. In the context of a dire game, West Ham's opener was as unexpected as it was welcome for the neutral. A cross aimed at Carroll was headed as far as O'Brien on the right and the full-back's shot was turned in by Nolan. The Hammers midfielder, who declined to perform his trademark chicken dance celebration against his old club, could have doubled the lead moments later but he sliced his left-footed shot wide from the edge of the box. Newcastle's rally, which began before the break with half-chances for Hatem Ben Arfa and Yohan Cabaye, almost brought the equaliser within a minute of the restart. Ba's powerful header bounced awkwardly in front of Jaaskelainen, who clawed the ball back from the goal-line. Newcastle's players were convinced the ball had crossed the line but inconclusive replays appeared to justify the officials' decision not to award a goal. The Magpies continued to press forward but their play lacked subtlety in the final third. Most of the home side's best chances came from corners, with half-time substitute Shola Ameobi wasting a free header from Cabaye's perfect delivery. Newcastle's commitment to attack was always likely to leave gaps at the back and when Carroll capitalised on a defensive mix-up to exchange passes with Nolan, the former Geordie favourite found himself clean through on goal. Carroll's slight hesitation, however, gave Krul time to set himself and pull off an excellent stop with his outstretched left hand. The hosts' desperation for an equaliser saw Krul sent up for a late corner, but the Hammers held on for their first win at St James' Park since October 1998.  Newcastle boss Alan Pardew: "We are kicking ourselves. It was the West Ham performance we knew we were going to get but what we lacked was the verve and imagination to unlock them. "We had eight or nine shots but none with any purpose or quality. Newcastle at home must score one, two, three or maybe 4 and we got none today. "It's nothing to do with our European game - we made lots of changes and the team was fresh - but we didn't do ourselves justice in the first 30 minutes. We didn't come alive until they scored and that is not good enough. "We've got a home game [against Swansea] next week and we're under pressure to produce a performance and win."

24.04.2013 23:34:12 Edin Dzeko's late winner gave Manchester City a dramatic victory over Tottenham that keeps them in touch with leaders Manchester United and just two points off the top of the Premier League. Spurs led through Steven Caulker's first-half header before Sergio Aguero drew City level. Dzeko, so often City's hero this season, came off the bench to snatch the three points with two minutes to go. The Bosnia striker detests the term "super-sub", claiming it does not show him enough respect, but he again showed his worth as a late replacement after coming on for Carlos Tevez. Dzeko exchanged passes with David Silva before slamming an unstoppable shot past Brad Friedel - his sixth league goal of the season and his fifth as a substitute. In total, his goals have helped City earn nine vital points in their pursuit of their neighbours United and Chelsea. For long spells against Spurs, City's unbeaten start to the season looked under threat, not because of poor defending, but because of an inability to take the numerous chances that came their way. Dzeko apart, the champions are finding it much harder to find the net than they did when hitting 93 goals on the way to winning last season's title. Because of that, even sporadic failings at the back are potentially far more costly. That was the case here, as Spurs soaked up some early pressure then scored with their first serious effort on goal. And, just as in midweek against Ajax, it was a set-piece that was City's undoing. Caulker met Tom Huddlestone's whipped free-kick and Joe Hart was unable to keep his header out. The England keeper will argue his defence should have dealt with the delivery better but will also be angry with himself for allowing the ball to bounce over his line. City's initial response was underwhelming. In fact, Spurs almost quickly doubled their lead as Emmanuel Adebayor, a nuisance throughout against his former club, teed up Huddlestone to skid a shot wide. And, when the home side did come forward, referee Michael Oliver rejected two shouts for a penalty. The first was for a handball by William Gallas that would have been harsh; the second for a foul by Huddlestone on Pablo Zabaleta that looked far more clear cut. Other than that, City struggled to make headway, with Spurs digging in. That justified Andre Villas-Boas's decision to play with only Emmanuel Adebayor up front, the Togo striker getting the nod over Jermain Defoe, despite the England man hitting a hat-trick on Thursday.  The pattern continued after the break, with City camped in the Tottenham half but unable to find a way through the visitors. Aguero stumbled as he ran clear from Toure's lobbed pass, but that was the closest they came to a meaningful chance. Then came Mancini's first change after 56 minutes, with Maicon on for Matija Nastasic, and a change of system that allowed the Brazilian and Aleksandar Kolarov to raid forward as wing-backs. That stretched the previously solid-looking Spurs defence, and an equaliser soon followed. City were fortunate that the ball found its way to Aguero on the right of the box, but there was nothing lucky about his finish, with the Argentine turning inside Caulker before slotting past Friedel. Anxiety among the home fans was suddenly replaced by belief and expectation, none more so than when Dzeko made his entrance with 17 minutes to go. Chance after chance followed for Mancini's men, with a Dzeko effort being deflected into the side netting, Silva rolling a shot wide, Friedel denying Dzeko and Aguero also testing the Tottenham keeper. Spurs did threaten on the break when Gareth Bale found space to smash in a shot that Hart had to beat away, but otherwise it was one-way traffic. And Dzeko delivered the goods again with two minutes to go when he fed Silva then ran into the box to meet the return pass, swivelling to fizz an unstoppable shot past Friedel.

24.04.2013 23:34:12 Manchester United produced a rousing second-half display to recover from two goals down and snatch a famous win from a breathless encounter at Villa Park. The Premier League leaders found themselves 2-0 behind after 50 minutes, with Aston Villa's Andreas Weimann striking either side of half-time. The introduction of Javier Hernandez at half-time changed everything, however. Sandwiched by a Ron Vlaar own goal, the United striker scored twice to complete a remarkable turnaround. Hernandez, who has now found the net seven times in his last five matches, was enveloped by his team-mates at the final whistle after United's 14th victory in their last 16 matches, a result that leaves Sir Alex Ferguson's side four points clear at the top of the table. Incredibly, the Old Trafford club have won 15 points from losing positions this season. And yet these late United comebacks retain something of a jack-in-the-box quality. Everyone suspects they are on the cards and yet still catch their opponents by surprise. This was no exception. At 2-0 down, United had created for themselves an utter mess. And yet somehow they rose to find hope, and with it, power and effectiveness to turn around a lost match in seven impossible minutes and finished the job with three minutes of normal time remaining. It was tough on Villa after a brave performance but history was always on United's side. The last time United lost here in the league was August 1995. On that day Ferguson threw David Beckham, Paul Scholes, Nicky Butt and the Nevilles into the mix and Alan Hansen had warned him he wouldn't win anything with kids. But it is Villa who are fielding the fledglings these days - seven of Lambert's side were 23 or younger, including 22-year-old Enda Stevens who made his full league debut. United had all the experience. Scholes, who started in that United team 17 years ago, turned in another vintage midfield performance, sitting deep and spraying his trademark laser-guided passes to all corners of Villa Park. But for all of United's possession they lacked cohesion, confidence and sustained threat for 50 minutes. Villa were two goals to the good by the time United woke from their slumber. Weimann scored both to shake United to their core. First he found Benteke with a perfectly measured ball down the left and, when his strike partner pulled back a low cross, thumped a fizzing drive past David De Gea from 16 yards. The interval did little to steady United as Villa began where they had left off and doubled their lead within four minutes. Ireland swept the ball left for Agbonlahor and the Villa forward's low ball skidded across the six-yard line where Weimann escaped Rio Ferdinand's attention to sidefoot in. Villa Park was rocking and yet somehow United turned the match on its head. Ferguson's decision to replace Ashley Young with Hernandez at half-time changed the game in seven second-half minutes as United struck twice to level the match from nowhere. Scholes, in the centre circle, set Hernandez scampering clear down the inside-right channel, the ball became caught under his feet in the box but in a flash it was out again and rolling beyond Guzan and into the back of the net. Vlaar was producing a towering performance at the heart of the defence, throwing his body and head into the path of shots and crosses with tremendous regularity as United pushed and probed around the edge of the penalty area. But even he was powerless to prevent United's second as Hernandez fired Rafael goalwards and the volley deflected into the net off the Dutchman. Villa were visibly shaken. Rooney's long-range shot was palmed clear by Guzan while Robin Van Persie struck the crossbar twice in one minute, first with a thumping header and then a fierce long-range shot. Down at the other end, Barry Bannan - one of many Villa players to impress - found the head of Weimann with a curling cross from deep and the Austrian striker powered a header straight at De Gea, who turned the ball to safety with a brilliant reflex save. But United would not be denied. Van Persie curled a free-kick towards the far post where Hernandez headed the ball into the bottom-right corner with unerring accuracy. Ferguson's clenched fist at the final whistle said it all, United had done it again.  Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson: "It was a magnificent result and a magnificent game. Villa did fantastic today, they ran their socks off. We have to feel for them but we never gave in. We hit the bar twice but it was after the second goal we came alive, and it was a fantastic game. I admire the tenacity of the performance, though. When they need to do it, they do it."  Villa manager Paul Lambert: "We gave it absolutely everything, we were brilliant. I can't fault the team. We've got lots of young lads in the team and they were great. I can't ask for any more from them.

24.04.2013 23:34:12 Mikel Arteta missed a last-minute penalty as Arsenal had to settle for a draw after a thrilling six-goal encounter with Fulham. Olivier Giroud's header and Lukas Podolski's close-range strike looked to have put the Gunners in control. But Dimitar Berbatov inspired a Fulham reply, heading in before teeing up Alex Kacaniklic's 40th-minute equaliser. Berbatov's spot-kick gave the visitors a 3-2 lead but Giroud levelled, before Mark Schwarzer saved Arteta's penalty. It was a dramatic climax to an exciting match, with referee Phil Dowd blowing the final whistle immediately after the Australian keeper's full-stretch save low to his left. Had the penalty gone in Fulham would have felt aggrieved, as the award of a spot-kick against Sascha Riether looked harsh, with the defender doing his best to withdraw his arm as Andrei Arshavin crossed. Arsenal might have expected an altogether less eventful afternoon - they have not lost at home to Fulham in 108 years. But they had more reason than usual to fear the visitors before this match, having made their worst start to a Premier League season under manager Arsene Wenger. Add to that the fact the Cottagers are no longer the pushovers they once were on the road - they had earned 16 points from their previous 16 away matches and were level with the Gunners on 15 points before kick-off - and there was plenty of cause for concern at Emirates Stadium. But any pessimism generated by the Gunners' run of three defeats in their previous six matches quickly evaporated as the home side seized the initiative. Despite seeing little of the ball in the opening exchanges, they took the lead when Giroud headed in from Theo Walcott's right-wing corner after 11 minutes. It was a timely second league goal of the season for Giroud, who is under pressure for his central striking role from Walcott and Podolski, who have both stated their desire to start up front rather than out wide. But the attacking trio's shape was clearly working, as midway through the half, with Fulham temporarily down to 10 men because of an injury to Kieran Richardson, Podolski doubled the lead, converting from six yards following Arteta's cutback. Fulham, though, refused to be discouraged and continued to probe patiently. Only the division's top team, Manchester United, have scored more than them this season and they soon showed their attacking prowess. Much of their potency has come via Berbatov, who was central to their swift response, first capitalising on static Arsenal marking to nod in from Bryan Ruiz's corner, then turning provider to cross for Alex Kacaniklic to head beyond Vito Mannone. Arsenal needed a show of character and Walcott, on his first Premier League start since the opening day of the season, began to emerge as a threat. But, against the run of play, Arteta dawdled on the edge of his area and was robbed of possession by Ruiz, who was then bundled over by the Arsenal midfielder, with Dowd pointing to the spot. Berbatov coolly converted for his second of the match to give Fulham hope of a historic victory in north London. Arsenal, though, responded almost instantly. After being played in by Santi Cazorla, Giroud's shot struck the post but bounced out to Walcott, who crossed for the Frenchman to score his second header of the match. Both sides had chances to snatch victory, with Giroud going close to a hat-trick with a 30-yard effort saved by Schwarzer and Ashkan Dejagah failing to capitalise when in space inside the area before Arteta's penalty miss. But a point apiece was ultimately a fair outcome from a game which both sides will feel they might have won.  Fulham manager Martin Jol: "We played some fantastic stuff. Before the game we said we would try to dominate them, which is hard here, but we managed that. "I can't remember being 2-0 down - especially here - then being 3-2 ahead and we could have scored two or three goals after that. "I really thought this could be the first time ever [for Fulham] to beat them away, but in the end it was not to be. "However, if you concede a penalty in the last 20 seconds and then still do not lose, maybe we should be pleased in hindsight."

24.04.2013 23:34:12 Everton fought back to seal a victory over Sunderland that keeps them in the top four of the Premier League. Adam Johnson swept home his first goal for Sunderland to give the Black Cats the lead on the stroke of half-time. But Everton's dominance paid off with two goals in three second-half minutes. Marouane Fellaini drilled a shot into the bottom corner, before his sublime flick set up Nikica Jelavic to steer home the winner in boss David Moyes' 400th Premier League game. It was the sixth time in a row Everton have managed to avoid defeat after conceding the first goal, and extended Moyes's unbeaten run over Sunderland to 18 games. Despite losing the creativity of Kevin Mirallas to a hamstring injury in the first half, the Toffees bombarded the Sunderland goal throughout the second half and were rewarded with a victory that ended a run of four straight draws. Sunderland boss Martin O'Neill, whose team are now only three points above the relegation zone, saw his goal-shy side fail to convert three clear-cut chances in the first half, two of which arrived inside the first 10 minutes. Everton keeper Tim Howard - watched from the stands by United States manager Jurgen Klinsmann - showed off the talents that have made him his country's number one by pulling off a sharp low save to deny Stephane Sessegnon after the Benin international had been played in by Steven Fletcher. Sessegnon then returned the favour to set up Fletcher, who dragged his low shot across the face of Howard's goal. Everton responded with a period of sustained pressure, with their brilliant Belgians Mirallas and Fellaini pulling the strings in midfield. Their best chance came the way of Steven Pienaar, whose shot from the right drew a routine save from Simon Mignolet at his near post. Sadly for the Blues, Mirallas appeared to tweak a hamstring in threading the ball through to Pienaar, and could play no further part. Despite Everton's pressure and territorial dominance, Sunderland continued to create the better chances. Jack Colback wasted a chance from the inside-right channel with a weak shot at Howard. And, on the stroke of half-time, Jelavic's headed clearance from a corner fell to Gardner, who clipped the ball back over the Everton defence for Johnson to fire past Howard. Predictably, Everton began the second half on the front foot and came close to taking the lead when John Heitinga's header from a corner was cleared off the line by Johnson. The one-way traffic continued but time after time, full-backs Leighton Baines and Seamus Coleman found space on the flanks, only to fail to pick out a blue shirt with their cross. Sunderland's resistance was finally broken with 15 minutes remaining when substitute Steven Naismith's pass found Fellaini, who turned sharply and shot low from the edge of the box past an unsighted Mignolet. Three minutes later, Leon Osman fed Fellaini on the edge of the box, and the Belgian's clever flick through John O'Shea's legs set up Jelavic to curl in. With 10 minutes left, Sunderland fashioned a chance to level, but Carlos Cuellar's close-range shot struck Gardner on the back and deflected to safety.  Everton manager David Moyes: "We kept knocking on the door, never gave up, trying to score and forcing the issue. Sunderland made it really difficult for us because they have a great defensive record and are good on counter-attack. "I thought we were unlucky to come in 1-0 down because our play was good but we gave them a few chances. We will have to look at that and try to do a bit better. "The best teams can attack and are strong in defence. Getting that balance is how you become top team, scoring plenty of goals and not conceding too many. I don't want us to be giving the opposition too many chances."  Sunderland manager Martin O'Neill: "We could have been three up by half-time. We had three great chances and finally got a goal which we deserved. "We were under pressure in the second half and they hit us with two goals in about a minute and a half. "There is great sprit among the players and that was epitomised today. We are playing a team that is going for a Champions League spot and we played brilliantly today and were very unlucky. "Danny Rose's booking in the last couple of moments of the game beggars belief. It was unbelievable and that was the story of the game. When the referee sees it again he will be embarrassed.

24.04.2013 23:34:12 Reading continued to be frustrated in search of their first Premier League win of the season as they were held to a draw by a stubborn Norwich. Garath McCleary had a well-struck shot saved by Canaries' keeper John Ruddy in a first half short of chances. The home side upped the pace after the break and Sean Morrison headed wide before Jobi McAnuff shot over the top. A Jimmy Kebe cross hit the Norwich crossbar while, at the other end, an unmarked Grant Holt nodded wide. Reading have now drawn six of their 10 top-flight games this season and, while they have struggled to hold onto leads, they did not even have the chance to do so in a game in which both chances and quality were at a premium. Norwich have improved defensively recently and their first clean sheet away from home in 39 Premier League games dating back to October 2004 helped them to an eighth point out of a maximum of 12. The Canaries have also not conceded in three of their last four games and it was their durability which again came to the fore at the Madejski stadium. The game quickly assumed the pattern of Reading being comfortably held at bay as they pressed for an opener, while the visitors tried to catch out their hosts on the counter attack. McCleary's powerful long-range shot was fended away by keeper Ruddy but, along with Royals counterpart Adam Federici, he had little to do. The match stuttered along with headers from Reading defender Kaspars Gorkss and Norwich midfielder Robert Snodgrass going high and wide. Canaries centre-back Sebastien Bassong was caught in possession, resulting in a Jason Roberts cross being put into the side-netting by visiting defender Michael Turner. Reading boss Brian McDermott sent on striker Pavel Pogrebnyak and winger Kebe in the hope of kick-starting his side into some sort of attacking threat. The move had a slight impact and Reading went close when centre-back Sean Morrison headed a free-kick narrowly wide. McAnuff cut inside and fired over the Norwich goal, before Kebe's right-wing cross bounced off the top of the crossbar. There was a lack of goal threat from both teams but when the opportunities did arrive they also failed to show the finishing touch to take them. Canaries' striker Holt had two openings as Reading attacked and left themselves open but the Norwich striker headed both off target.  Reading manager Brian McDermott:  "We could have nicked it. I thought in the first half both teams looked nervous. "I made a couple of changes to try to win the game [but] it is a clean sheet and gives us a good platform to try to build on. We didn't create enough chances for our strikers. "We need to dig in at times like this and we will just try to catch the team in front of us and then the one in ahead of them."  Norwich boss Chris Hughton:  "A point away from home to whoever in the Premier League is a decent result. In the end, the way the game opened up I thought it was us that would get the three points. "We had to defend very well and we did excellently in that department. "All in all, I think a draw is a fair result. It's about the other end now and, perhaps, taking the opportunities we have."

24.04.2013 23:34:12 Southampton squandered more points from a winning position as a defensive howler allowed Swansea to end a run of three successive away defeats. Morgan Schneiderlin put the beleaguered Saints ahead with a composed finish from Rickie Lambert's set-up. But Swansea were level nine minutes later when former Saint, Nathan Dyer, pounced on Maya Yoshida's poor control to find the bottom corner. Daniel Fox's last-ditch stretch denied Itay Shechter a late Swansea winner. Southampton move off the bottom after Queens Park Rangers lost at Stoke, but that will be scant consolation for manager Nigel Adkins as he fights to save his job.  The Saints have now surrendered 13 points from winning positions this season, and they were the masters of their own downfall after gifting Swansea an equaliser they hardly looked like getting. Dyer, a graduate of Southampton's academy, took the chance well and gave Swansea their first point on the road since their 5-0 win at QPR on the opening day of the season. Southampton came into the match knowing that only once has a team not been relegated after losing eight of their first 10 games. The tension surrounding the club's predicament manifested itself in the stands, resulting in a subdued atmosphere at St Mary's. The Saints certainly played the more direct football and had early sights at goal through Adam Lallana and Gaston Ramirez that failed to trouble Gerhard Tremmel in the Swansea goal. Centre-back Jose Fonte was also denied at the far post by a lunging block from Swansea's 19-year-old left-back Ben Davies. His opposite number, 17-year-old Luke Shaw, became the youngest Southampton player to make a Premier League start and acquitted himself well against Swansea's record signing Pablo Hernandez. Most of Swansea's limited attacks veered towards Shaw's flank. The most significant opening of the first half released right-back Angel Rangel, but his low cross from inside the area was cleared at the front post with Michu unmarked in front of goal. The striker stood alone in the tunnel for several minutes at half-time, an indication of the visitors' growing frustration at the lack of any cutting edge or spark. Home pressure finally began to grow after the break and Sung-Yueng Ki, who forced the only save from Southampton keeper Paulo Gazzaniga in the first half, made a crucial intervention to deny Lambert. Garry Monk, making his 250th appearance for Swansea at the club that launched his career, then threw himself to block a Ramirez shot. But the pressure finally told as Schneiderlin scored to release a wave of relief around St Mary's. Lambert had won his fair share of headers and when he rose unchallenged at the far post to head across the face of goal, Schneiderlin showed great agility to chest the ball and then head past the advancing Tremmel. The lead lasted all of nine minutes, though. Gazzaniga's pass put centre-back Maya Yoshida under unnecessary pressure and his poor first touch allowed Dyer to pounce. The winger, a 56th-minute substitute, drove into the area and his low strike across the face of goal went in off the post. Lambert twice threatened with headers but a sense of nervousness grew among the home defence and only a desperate lunge from Fox denied Shechter a tap-in.

24.04.2013 23:34:12 Charlie Adam's first goal for Stoke sent Queens Park Rangers to the bottom of the Premier League table and put more pressure on manager Mark Hughes. Midfielder Adam capitalised on hesitant defending to drive a shot beyond Julio Cesar early in the second half. QPR had chances to equalise, with Adel Taarabt going close on a number of occasions, while Asmir Begovic did well to keep out Esteban Granero's effort. But Stoke held firm to record only their second victory of the season. Southampton's 1-1 draw against Swansea resulted in the Saints leapfrogging the Hoops at the foot of the table. QPR, searching for their first league win, were hoping for a repeat of last season's corresponding fixture. Their 3-2 win at the Britannia Stadium 12 months ago was the last time they savoured all three points on the road. Hughes's side certainly started brightly enough as they enjoyed plenty of possession during the early exchanges. But a lack of ideas in the final third cost them dearly, and there was always the danger they would be caught out by Stoke. In the eighth minute, Adam gave notice of his intentions, striking a low drive from just outside the area which took a nick off a defender as it flew just wide. The visitors continued to see plenty of the ball, but were still not really troubling the Stoke defence and, as the half wore on, the home side started to improve. They came within inches of breaking the deadlock in the 37th minute as Geoff Cameron, Adam and Steven Nzonzi all combined before the latter sent a low ball into the area for Peter Crouch, whose shot was deflected just wide by Anton Ferdinand. But the best opportunity for either side in the first half came a minute before the break. Junior Hoilett led a quick counter for QPR and squared a pass to put Taarabt clear, but the mercurial Moroccan floated his dinked effort onto the roof of the net when he perhaps would have been better to opt for power. Stoke capitalised fully in the 52nd minute when Robert Huth's free-kick into the area was flicked on by Jon Walters.  The ball fell to Adam at the back post, and the former Liverpool midfielder drove a half-volley beyond Cesar. Taarabt almost responded a minute later when his deflected shot was pushed over by Begovic. The tricky forward then wriggled his way past two defenders but could only flick the ball wide. QPR continued to pressure the Stoke defence and only a superb save by Begovic, clawing away a Granero strike that looked destined for the top corner, prevented an equaliser. But the visitors failed to capitalise on their spell of pressure and eventually Stoke regained control of the game to finish the half strongly and only a fine, low save by Cesar from Michael Kightly's shot prevented Stoke's lead being doubled.  Stoke manager Tony Pulis said: "It was an important win for us. We have played very well in the first 10 games but not really got the return we deserved. Today was as average a performance as we have put in but the big thing was to get three points. "It was an open game today and the first goal was always going to be important. QPR had chances and if one of them went in it would have been difficult for us to come back. "During our time in the Premier League it has evolved that teams are showing us much more respect and it is something we have to deal with. We are evolving as a much more fluent team but we want to evolve in getting results as well."

24.04.2013 23:34:12 West Brom maintained their excellent start under manager Steve Clarke with a deserved win at Wigan, keeping them fifth in the Premier League. James Morrison headed the Baggies ahead from Chris Brunt's cross before Gary Caldwell deflected Billy Jones' effort into his own net. Wigan reduced the deficit through Arouna Kone's close-range finish. But the Baggies deserved the points, Ali Al Habsi only denying Romelu Lukaku a third goal with a stunning save. This was West Brom's first away win under Clarke. But on this evidence, former Baggies manager Roberto Di Matteo could be in for an uncomfortable return when his Chelsea side visit The Hawthorns next Saturday. West Brom are flourishing under Clarke, whose bold tactical switches are paying off. Peter Odemwingie scored both goals in his side's 2-0 win over Southampton at the start of the week, yet the Nigerian international found himself on the bench at the DW Stadium as Clarke switched to a 4-4-2 formation. Despite Odemwingie's omission, West Brom raced into a 2-0 lead as the Latics failed to carry on from where they left off at White Hart Lane seven days earlier.  Wigan 1-2 West Brom  Having frustrated Tottenham with a strong defensive performance during a 1-0 win in north London, Wigan conceded two sloppy goals in the space of 12 first-half minutes. They fell behind against the run of play when the unmarked Morrison powered home Brunt's excellent 31st-minute cross from six yards out. The hosts then allowed Billy Jones to burst into the penalty area and the defender's shot took a heavy deflection off Gary Caldwell into the net two minutes before half-time. Kone did pull a goal back for Wigan a minute before half-time, Jean Beausejour's impressive low cross finding the Ivory Coast striker unmarked inside the six-yard area. But the hosts, who started brightly and faded badly, failed to test Boaz Myhill enough in what was the Wales keeper's first competitive outing since conceding six against Serbia in a World Cup qualifier in September. Indeed it was his opposite number Al Habsi who was the busier of the two keepers, the Oman international producing a terrific stop to tip Lukaku's attempt from 12 yards over the bar in the second half.  Wigan manager Roberto Martinez:  "I don't think we are the sort of side that can get a result out of a scrappy performance. "We know West Brom are a very strong unit and play with real confidence and are a difficult unit to break down, so to concede two goals early on was really disappointing. "We are frustrated with our performance."  West Brom manager Steve Clarke:  "This week we're happy with where we are. I know it sounds boring, but we just have to keep working from game to game. "I remember once as a player I was top of the league in November and ended up fighting relegation. The top division in England can come back quickly to bite you if you take your focus off it. "Our away performances have been as good as our home performances so this is long overdue."

24.04.2013 23:34:12 Peter Odemwingie scored twice as West Bromwich Albion put further pressure on Premier League strugglers Southampton with victory at The Hawthorns. Odemwingie opened the scoring with a shot from outside the box towards the end of the first half. Rickie Lambert struck the bar just after the break, before Odemwingie rounded off a fine West Brom counter by heading beyond Paulo Gazzaniga. The win means West Brom climb to fifth, while Southampton remain bottom. West Brom have enjoyed their best start to a season for decades, but two successive defeats might have given Southampton hope they had caught Steve Clarke's side at the right time. The Saints, wary of the need to start picking up points quickly, were immediately probing for an opening and it was they who had the first attempt on target, but Lambert's low drive from the right of the box was saved well by Ben Foster. For all of Southampton's good build-up play they were almost punished for a lack of concentration in defence after 20 minutes. Odemwingie hit a low effort that was going wide until Zoltan Gera stuck out a boot, but the Hungarian succeeded only in diverting the ball over the bar from six yards. Southampton did not lessen their attacking intent despite that scare and had a chance just before the half hour when Gaston Ramirez smartly clipped the ball into the middle of the area for Lambert, but the striker directed his header straight at Ben Foster. Immediately afterwards the visitors were issued a warning about their defensive frailties when Odemwingie embarked on a swift counter and, with defenders failing to close him down, he drove a shot just wide of the post. It was a warning that Southampton did not heed as the hosts opened the scoring nine minutes before the break. Youssouf Mulumbu found himself in acres of space down the right before playing a pass to Odemwingie who, with plenty of space ahead of him, drove a shot goalwards and the ball took a slight deflection off Maya Yoshida on its way into the net. Lambert struck the woodwork soon after the restart after a fortuitous deflection from Gareth McAuley's attempted clearance rebounded to the striker inside the area, but his sidefooted effort hit the bar. There was little Southampton could do, though, when West Brom scored a second on the hour. Liam Ridgewell played a pinpoint ball from defence to Shane Long on the left flank and the Republic of Ireland international curled a perfect cross into the area as Odemwingie raced to power a header beyond Gazzaniga. That effectively ended the game as a contest but West Brom came close to scoring again with just over 10 minutes remaining, when substitute Romelu Lukaku lofted the ball across the area for the onrushing Chris Brunt, but his volleyed effort flew wide of the far post. There was just time for Southampton to almost snatch a late consolation but Foster did well to race off his line and stop Adam Lallana's poked effort as West Brom recorded a fifth win in six home games.  West Brom manager Steve Clarke said: "Our performance was perhaps not as good as it has been but we controlled the game and we got the win we wanted. "It's been a good start and it is not for me to take the credit. The players have been fantastic. They have got the reward for that. "We said from the start that our primary objective was to make sure that Albion are playing in the Premier League next season."

24.04.2013 23:34:12 Paolo Di Canio's reign as Sunderland manager began with a defeat at Chelsea that leaves The Black Cats deep in the fight to stay in the Premier League. The Italian had the start he wanted when Cesar Azpilicueta's own goal gave Sunderland a surprise lead moments before half-time. Sunderland's renewed optimism was short-lived, however, as Chelsea were in front 10 minutes after the interval as a result of another own goal, this time a deflection off Matt Kilgallon, and Branislav Ivanovic's touch on a David Luiz shot. Di Canio, watching with his flamboyant gestures and constant interaction with his players and backroom staff, will provide a compelling spectacle in the tense closing phases of the season. There is no doubt, however, that Sunderland are in serious trouble despite the effort and fight shown here. For all this, they look desperately short of attacking inspiration. And Sunday's Tyne-Wear derby against Newcastle United at St. James' Park now assumes even greater importance. Chelsea's interim manager Rafael Benitez can reflect on a highly satisfactory week, with an important victory to move the Blues up to third in the Premier League, following on from wins against Manchester United in the FA Cup and Rubin Kazan in the Europa League. Di Canio's entrance was understated, with a polite wave in response to a warm reception from Sunderland's fans and an embrace from John Terry as the Chelsea captain took his place on the substitutes' bench. It was not long, however, before he was an animated figure in his technical area, in regular dialogue with his backroom team, bellowing instructions to his players and even giving defender Phil Bardsley a robust slap on the cheek at one point - a slap of encouragement, it should be stressed. Sunderland acquitted themselves well in the opening half as they restricted Chelsea's chances, and then took the lead seconds before the break. John O'Shea directed Adam Johnson's corner towards goal and Azpilicueta made a hash of his attempted clearance, sending a slice into his own net. Benitez responded at the start of the second half with the introduction of Fernando Torres for Demba Ba, who struggled after a heavy challenge that earned Craig Gardner a booking which will rule him out of next Sunday's game at Newcastle. It was a change that brought instant dividends as Chelsea drew level with another messy goal. The striker, playing in a mask after suffering a broken nose, produced a surge of pace to find Oscar, whose shot ended in the net via Sunderland keeper Simon Mignolet and Kilgallon, who was debited with the own goal. Chelsea were ahead after 55 minutes, with Ivanovic reacting quickly to divert Luiz's long-range shot out of the reach of Mignolet. Sunderland struggled to recover from Chelsea's response and it was no surprise when Di Canio made his first change with 20 minutes left, sending on James McClean for Seb Larsson. But there was to be no late rescue act as Di Canio was given an illustration of the task awaiting him as he attempts to preserve Sunderland's Premier League status. Despite the defeat, the Black Cats remain outside of the bottom three but only on goal difference as 18th-placed Wigan picked up a point at QPR.   Chelsea interim manager Rafael Benitez:  "We needed to improve after the break obviously. The negative thing is we conceded a goal, the positive thing is we recovered and came back. "In the last 15 minutes we were a bit under pressure, but after four games in eight days that has to be expected. "Sunderland have a new manager, they were compact and organised so it was not easy to find space. Some players are a bit tired, but after so many games it is not easy and you have to change players."

24.04.2013 23:34:12 Luis Suarez scored a stunning goal as a dominant Liverpool were held to a point by 10-man Newcastle at Anfield. The Uruguayan brilliantly controlled a long ball from Jose Enrique ball on his shoulder before rounding keeper Tim Krul and scoring with his third touch. Newcastle's Yohan Cabaye showed the finishing prowess the Reds lacked in the first half when he powered in an acute angled strike before the break. Fabricio Coloccini was sent off for a dangerous challenge on Suarez late on. While Liverpool have now gone five league games without a defeat - their longest unbeaten run in 2012 - it was a game in which the familiar story of their season unfolded as they failed to make the most of their possession and chances. The visitors displayed defensive fortitude to frustrate their hosts, but Suarez's goal denied the Magpies a first win at Anfield in 18 league games since April 1994. Skipper Steven Gerrard was playing his 600th game for the Reds - moving him to 10th in the club's list of all-time appearance makers - and the midfielder has been the inspiration for his team on a regular basis since his debut in November 1998. But it was Suarez who was Newcastle's chief tormentor in a game the Reds began with obvious urgency. The home side did not take long to get into their passing stride and they quickly started to pile on the pressure, with winger Raheem Sterling's pace and trickery a particular concern for the visitors. Suarez is never far from the action and he was soon left indignant when referee Anthony Taylor ignored his penalty appeal after he was caught by Coloccini. Newcastle had to show the steel that has been a hallmark of their game this season to keep the Reds at arm's length. The closest Liverpool came to a goal in the first half was when Suarez had an angled shot across goal saved by the foot of keeper Tim Krul and a Suso strike was deflected over. But the visitors gradually came into the game and then stunned the home side by taking the lead. Hatem Ben Arfa jinked to the byline and crossed to the far post where Cabaye controlled before rifling home a shot. It was a goal that highlighted exactly the type of ruthlessness in front of goal Liverpool sorely miss. Suarez had a low curling shot saved and Nuri Sahin scuffed an effort narrowly wide as it seemed Liverpool's problems in front of goal would continue. But, after Jonas Gutierrez gave the ball away, Suarez brilliantly took down a long Enrique pass before touching the ball around Krul and slotting into an empty net. The Uruguayan then set up Jonjo Shelvey and Sterling for chances to win the game but both wasted their opportunities. Shelvey failed to get the required purchase on a pull-back, while Sterling was denied when his shot was deflected high off the sliding Steven Taylor. As Liverpool pressed for a late goal, Newcastle almost exposed the home side at the back with Papiss Cisse volleying wide and Ben Arfa having a shot saved by keeper Brad Jones. Coloccini's 84th-minute dismissal put the visitors under some late pressure and a deflected Suarez free-kick looped over before both teams had to settle for a draw.

24.04.2013 23:34:12 Struggling QPR and Reading are still searching for their first Premier League win of the season after playing out a disjointed draw at Loftus Road. Kaspars Gorkss's acrobatic volley gave the Royals a deserved first-half lead. But Rangers, who did hit the bar through Esteban Granero's free-kick, improved significantly after the break and levelled courtesy of Djibril Cisse's cool close-range finish. Adel Taarabt almost won it late on but Alex McCarthy saved with his feet. Taarabt's chance on the break, after great work by Cisse, was QPR's best opportunity of an increasingly frantic and end-to-end second period. But although Reading could also have won it late on when substitute Jimmy Kebe's shot was blocked - and had been much the better side before the interval - the visitors will ultimately have been relieved to hang on for a point after being outplayed for much of shapeless second half. The point is enough to lift QPR off the bottom of the table, moving them above Southampton on goal difference. But seeing as neither team had a Premier League victory between them prior to the game, two of the top flight's bottom three had pinpointed this fixture against fellow strugglers as an opportunity to put that right. And the match - although predictably short on real quality - at least provided plenty of tension and excitement from two teams desperate to get their season up and running. The Royals showed no signs of a hangover from their astonishing midweek Capital One Cup capitulation against Arsenal and played with confidence and discipline from the outset. Rangers old boy Gorkss misdirected a decent early headed chance and the busy Jay Tabb teed up Noel Hunt who screwed his shot wide. Their early dominance was rewarded when Gorkss smashed the ball home on the volley after Sean Morrison's looping header came back off the bar. Rangers manager Mark Hughes had said his side must start winning after a series of decent displays against some of the division's top sides had only produced three points from their opening nine games. But the patience of owner Tony Fernandes, who has continued to publicly back Hughes, will have been tested again by a sub-standard first-half performance. Stuttering Rangers were sloppy in possession and, in the main, restricted to a series of long-range efforts. The shooting threat came from moments of individual quality from Taarabt, Junior Hoilett and, to a lesser extent, Jamie Mackie and Cisse. Taarabt had at least four long-range strikes and Cisse smashed a shot over the bar after a purposeful run. But the closest they came was when Granero's fine free-kick produced a brilliant fingertip save from McCarthy during the home side's best spell of pressure. That dangerous period before the interval - and, no doubt, a half-time lecture from Hughes - sparked the hosts into life. And their improvement was rewarded when Cisse cleverly controlled Jose Bosingwa's right-wing cross with his first touch and poked the ball past McCarthy with his second. Taarabt soon tested McCarthy again and was then denied by the keeper's superb reaction stop with his right foot. At the other end, Reading's Jason Roberts had a shot blocked, as did Kebe after a mazy run. But neither side could find the crucial breakthrough and both remain winless and in the relegation zone.  Reading manager Brian McDermott:  "It was a good point and a really good away performance. "We could have had a second goal and I thought if we got that second goal, the game would have been done and dusted. But having said that, Alex McCarthy made a couple of wonderful saves and they hit the bar in the first half. "We showed great spirit I know these players. People talk about picking the players up [after losing to Arsenal], but it was never an issue. We have a real spirit and we just kept going. "QPR have some real quality, and Chelsea and Everton only drew here, so this in not an easy place to come to. We'll take the point."

24.04.2013 23:34:12 Manchester City maintained their unbeaten start in the Premier League but had to settle for a point from a hard-fought encounter with West Ham. The Hammers started brightly and were unlucky to see a Kevin Nolan goal ruled out for offside before Yossi Benayoun slammed a volley against the bar. City's best first-half chance saw Mario Balotelli miss from point-blank range. But the visitors improved after the break and Tevez and Gareth Barry wasted good opportunities before the end. It was a difficult evening for City boss Roberto Mancini, who perhaps gave a sign of his current frustrations when he came out early for the second half and sat on his own in his dug-out waiting for his players to emerge. Mancini saw his side fail to score for the first time since April and also had to deal with a temperamental reaction from striker Balotelli after taking the Italian off in the second half. But things could have been even worse for the champions had the officials not come to their rescue just four minutes into the game. Nolan found space to steer home Mark Noble's floated free-kick with a fine first-time finish but the goal was disallowed for offside - incorrectly, TV replays showed. The hoisted ball into the box, usually aimed towards Andy Carroll, was predictably a favourite tactic of Sam Allardyce's side but they came forward with intelligence down the flanks too. Mohamed Diame cut in from the left to fizz in a shot that was rising as it flew over Joe Hart's crossbar and Benayoun went even closer after running in to meet an enticing Matt Jarvis cross with a volley that clattered against the same piece of woodwork. Carroll's mere presence was a nuisance to City but he went close to breaking the deadlock himself too, when Benayoun returned his knockdown and the Hammers striker, with England boss Roy Hodgson watching from the stands, sent a low shot skidding inches wide. At the other end, City were functional rather than free-flowing in the early stages, perhaps because of an unfamiliar front-line that saw Balotelli, Tevez and Edin Dzeko starting together for the first time. Mancini's men showed little of the guile they will need to break down Ajax in their vital Champions League meeting on Tuesday until Balotelli blazed a Tevez free-kick over the bar 10 minutes before half-time. City did improve in attack after the break but they still struggled to test Hammers keeper Jussi Jaaskelainen, and his stop after Tevez met a deflected Dzeko cross was his first serious save. West Ham were never likely to lie down and Nolan and Andy Carroll both remained dangerous, with Carroll seeing an acrobatic effort deflect wide off Gael Clichy. But it was City who looked increasingly likely to take home the three points, with Tevez blasting over as he tried to round off a neat move and Barry bundling the ball wide after referee Howard Webb missed what appeared to be a handball from another Dzeko cross. By now the visitors had all the possession and Mancini tried a different combination in attack in an attempt to make a difference in front of goal, hauling off a visibly unhappy Balotelli and sending on Sergio Aguero instead. It was to no avail. Aguero stung Jaaskelainen's palms from a quickly-taken free-kick but that was as close as City came to snatching a late victory, leaving Mancini to dwell on dropped points as well as planning for next week's crunch clash with the Dutch champions.

24.04.2013 23:34:12 Substitute Steve Sidwell rescued a point for Fulham with an 90th-minute equaliser in a game which Everton should have won comfortably. Tim Howard was at fault as Fulham took an early lead, the Everton keeper pushing Bryan Ruiz's free-kick on to a post before the ball crossed the line. Marouane Fellaini deservedly levelled after good work by Kevin Mirallas. Fellaini got the better of Aaron Hughes to make it 2-1 before Sidwell poked home the equaliser from close range. Despite climbing to fourth in the table after stretching their unbeaten league run to seven games, this was definitely a case of two points dropped for Everton, who dominated from start to finish. The Cottagers should have been dead and buried before Sidwell struck, Nikica Jelavic responsible for two glaring misses in the first half alone. Toffees boss David Moyes looked distinctly unimpressed at the final whistle after being forced to settle for a fourth straight draw. Despite having now conceded in the opening 15 minutes in each of their last six games, his side looked to be coasting to victory. They had more than 20 shots, hit the woodwork and had another chance cleared off the line. There was little sign of what was to come when Phil Neville's clip on Dimitar Berbatov allowed Fulham to take the lead, Howard pushing Ruiz's 25-yard free-kick against the post before it rebounded back off him into the net. Everton's response was impressive. Unfortunately for the Blues, their finishing was not. Mark Schwarzer did well to deny Fellaini an equaliser while the Australian goalkeeper was also alert to deny Seamus Coleman before half-time. Then Jelavic wasted two fine chances, the first a header while unmarked just outside the six-yard box before the Croatian striker raced behind the home defence and lifted the ball over Schwarzer and the bar. Defender Phil Jagielka also went close with an ambitious attempt before Everton's pressure paid off, Fellaini picking his spot from eight yards after Mirallas had raced behind the Fulham defence in the 55th minute. Everton then had Howard to thank for keeping them on level terms, the United States international producing a terrific one-handed stop to frustrate Berbatov after the Bulgarian had beaten the offside trap. But Fellaini deservedly put Everton ahead in the 72nd minute after getting the better of Hughes in an aerial challenge before picking his spot with a low shot. And in a pulsating finish, Everton substitute Steven Naismith had a shot cleared off the line by Chris Baird and Fellaini had a shot deflected on to the post before Schwarzer kept out the Belgian's volley. Everton thought they had done enough to win, but Sidwell had the final say as he pounced at the back post after Berbatov missed Sascha Riether's low centre from the right, stretching Fulham's unbeaten league run to four games.  Fulham manager Martin Jol:  "Everton dominated us, all we could do was try to be positive. "But it doesn't mean anything in football if you don't score the goals. "They are a very good footballing team. They are a settled team and know exactly what to do. Normally we are a good team, but I couldn't see that today. "The only positive thing I can say is that we never gave up."  Everton manager David Moyes said:  "I'm really frustrated because if I really want to hang on to the boys at the top I need to win these games when they come along. "I can't believe we only got a draw out of that, it's incredible. "We've played really well this season but that one we should have won. We were terrific at times but couldn't get the goals."

24.04.2013 23:34:12 Norwich City stretched their unbeaten run to four games as Bradley Johnson's first-half header earned them victory over Stoke City in a scrappy game. Johnson guided the ball in from a controversial Robert Snodgrass free-kick at the end of a turgid first half. The visitors improved after the break and Kenwyne Jones wasted a good chance. But Stoke never looked like securing a first away win since January and the Canaries held on to climb above the Potters in the table. Norwich's recent resurgence has seen them win two of their last three Premier League games and move a point ahead of Stoke with 10 points from 10 games. And they were good value for the victory, albeit from a tame game in which Stoke only seriously threatened during a nervy finale. Having followed up last Saturday's impressive draw at Aston Villa with a battling - if slightly fortunate - win over Tottenham in the Capital One Cup in midweek, the Canaries had good reason for optimism against a side who had failed to win in 14 away Premier League fixtures. The Potters and their ever-bullish manager Tony Pulis would have argued that statistics can be deceiving. Stoke have already played both Manchester clubs, as well as Arsenal, Chelsea and Liverpool, so the fact they have only lost two league matches this term was probably the more noteworthy pre-match fact. But on this form it was plainly obvious as to why the visitors have drawn so many games. Although constantly - and often very harshly - criticised for a long-ball, football-by-numbers approach, Stoke seemed to lack the dynamism, creativity and ambition in attack. In Charlie Adam they have a player with undoubted quality, but he was rarely involved and their lack of adventure meant he had their only worthwhile efforts on goal in the first half. The midfielder shot narrowly wide with the first, a clever curled effort from 25 yards after a poor defensive clearance, and he then fired another long-range strike straight at keeper John Ruddy. But despite a decent spell in the latter stages of the opening period, it was Norwich who made most of the first-half running. Wes Hoolahan, who excelled against Villa last week, was unsurprisingly at the centre of nearly all the home side's good work. He was busy and dangerous throughout and teed up Anthony Pilkington, whose close-range strike was well kept out by the feet of visiting goalkeeper Asmir Begovic. That was the best opening of a listless first half until Johnson rose brilliantly to head home Snodgrass's inviting free-kick from the left. Stoke, who have now not won away from home in the league since beating Blackburn in January, felt the set-piece award was harsh and also that they should have had their own free-kick in the build-up for a foul on Adam. Pulis remonstrated with referee Andre Marriner at the interval but perhaps his main frustration was with his own side. The Potters improved on the resumption, but they still struggled to create chances despite spells of pressure. Jon Walters should have done better when presented with a one-on-one chance but shot straight at Ruddy. And substitute Jones could only send an excellent headed chance at the keeper, and then wasted an even better opening when he pulled a shot across goal from 12 yards. But Norwich defended resolutely and were able to withstand the pressure and claim only their second league victory of the season.  Norwich City manager Chris Hughton:  "You cannot be too disappointed when you have won, but we could have made life better for ourselves. "We needed to put a little more pressure on them. We could have done better when we had the ball and had two very good chances apart from scoring the goal. We should have pressed more, but that takes a lot of energy, especially when you are playing against a team like Stoke. "But I thought we dealt with it very well and apart from Kenwyne Jones' header we restricted them to a couple of half-chances."  Stoke City manager Tony Pulis:  "The goal was a disappointment. I have been in to see the referee to have a quick chat. I thought it certainly was not a free-kick, and the disappointing thing is when the lad falls, Andre [Marriner] and the linesman are so close to it. "He has booked Charlie in the first half for diving - I have just had a look at that and Javier Garrido pushes him in the back, so that is a double kick in the teeth when he gets both those decisions wrong and even worse when they score from it. "Referees give the decisions they see on the day, and he has seen it differently to what we have. When he sees it again on the television, he will have a different opinion. "Asmir Begovic did not really have many saves to make and in the second half, I thought we played like the home team. We had the two best chances of the game, and they have got to be scored. It is disappointing to come away with nothing."

24.04.2013 23:34:12 Gabriel Agbonlahor ended his run of 28 league games without a goal by scoring Aston Villa's winner at Sunderland. The striker broke the stalemate when he stabbed in from close range after a knock-down from Christian Benteke. Sunderland wanted a penalty when John O'Shea's glanced header struck the arm of Benteke but the referee waved away their appeals. Louis Saha headed a late Sebastian Larsson cross agonisingly over for the home side but Villa held on. A handful of Sunderland fans had begun to make their way out of the stadium after Saha's chance as they did not expect the top flight's lowest scoring side, with six goals, to equalise - and they were proved right. The defeat ended a week in which the struggling Black Cats were knocked out of the Capital One Cup by Middlesbrough and they have now won only once in their last 17 games. For Villa, on the other hand, this was a first league win in 14 away games since January and, after they reached the last eight of the Capital One Cup in midweek, their latest success will provide more encouragement for Paul Lambert. Lambert's side gave him only his second Premier League win as Villa manager and helped him come out on top against his mentor, Sunderland boss Martin O'Neill, who managed him for five years at Celtic. Although there is plenty of respect between the pair, this was a game in which both men were desperate for three points. Sunderland thought they had scored in the opening minutes when Steven Fletcher, who has scored five of his side's six league goals this season, dinked a Stephane Sessegnon pass over keeper Brad Guzan, only for the the effort to be correctly ruled out for offside. Lambert's side produced some promising play and delivered a warning of the goal that was to come when Agbonlahor latched on to Benteke's knock-down before having a shot deflected high off Bardsley. The home side's playmaking trio of Sebastian Larsson, Sessegnon and Adam Johnson have struggled to make their presence felt this season and they were again frustrated. After Sunderland skipper Lee Cattermole curled a strike a yard wide, a Larsson shot went out for a throw-in, perfectly illustrating the problems O'Neill's side have had in front of goal. The Black Cats stepped up the pace of their game after the break but it was Villa who took the lead. A right-wing Matthew Lowton cross was nodded down by Benteke and Agbonlahor was on hand to divert the ball past keeper Simon Mignolet. Sunderland had a shout for a penalty when Johnson's cross was flicked on by John O'Shea before coming off the arm of Benteke, although referee Mike Jones did not point to the spot. Saha headed over for the home side, who left themselves vulnerable on the counter-attack as they pressed forward. Villa's Andreas Weimann had a shot saved by Mignolet and, although Sunderland went close with another Cattermole shot and a Fraizer Campbell header, the home side's effort was to no avail.

24.04.2013 23:34:13 Chelsea failed to regain top spot in the Premier League from Manchester United as they conceded a late equaliser at Swansea. Victory looked a formality for Chelsea as they protected the lead given to them by a flicked Victor Moses header. But Pablo Hernandez beat Petr Cech from the edge of the area two minutes from time to rescue a point for the Swans. Gary Cahill, whose header set up Chelsea's goal, then blocked Danny Graham's late surge towards goal. Hernandez's goal gave Chelsea no time to react and ended an unsettling week for the Blues following their accusation of "inappropriate language" against referee Mark Clattenburg in last Sunday's 3-2 defeat by United. The home side were often better in possession than the visitors, but their lack of incisiveness in the final third gave no reason to suggest a late rally was on the cards. Chelsea lacked both the authority or guile of potential champions, although they looked to have done enough to return home with three points and reclaim top spot following United's earlier victory over Arsenal.  But they were caught with a classic sucker punch as Swansea followed Wednesday's Capital One Cup win over Liverpool with another impressive result. Chelsea carved out most of the limited scoring opportunities, the first of which came on 12 minutes when Leon Britton cleared a glancing Fernando Torres header off his own goal-line, providing a perfect example of the value of having a man guarding the far post. Britton would have been helpless, though, had a sliding Branislav Ivanovic managed to stretch an inch further to divert the ball in from two yards. Torres, returning from suspension, might have done better with another header after a driven Moses cross was deflected into his path. Ashley Williams looked back to his commanding best in marshalling the Swansea defence, aided by a lack of any great movement from the Chelsea front men. Such was the visitors' lack of invention it was early in the second half before Swansea goalkeeper Gerhard Tremmel was forced into his first save of note, diving low to keep out Eden Hazard's drive. A more spectacular saved followed from Hazard's free-kick, but the resulting corner delivered the opening goal. Cahill rose well to divert a header towards goal, and Moses was in the perfect position to flick the ball home from inside the six-yard box, giving him his first league goal on his first league start since his summer move from Wigan Athletic. Cech was almost a complete spectator in the Chelsea goal and was only forced into action in the final quarter to save long-range efforts from Jonathan de Guzman and Nathan Dyer. But he was beaten at full stretch with two minutes remaining when Hernandez produced a rare moment of quality to find the corner of the net with a curling effort from the edge of the box. A re-energized Swansea pressed for an unlikely winner and Cahill had to be alert to save Chelsea from further misery as he blocked Danny Graham's goalbound effort.

24.04.2013 23:34:13 Tottenham suffered a shock defeat at White Hart Lane as Ben Watson scored the only goal of the game to give Wigan a second successive Premier League win. The Wigan midfielder scored from close range early in the second half to give Roberto Martinez's side a famous win. Spurs were booed off after what is a second straight home defeat, having failed to score in a Premier League game for the first time this season. Spurs slip to fifth in the table, while Wigan move above Liverpool into 12th. Few would argue that Martinez's side did not deserve the points. Wigan, the team who could not beat Bradford in the League Cup on Tuesday, overcame the might of Spurs with a first-half performance packed with flair and attacking verve and a second-half display that highlighted their many defensive qualities. There was little comfort here for Andre Villas-Boas. In guiding Tottenham to five wins in six Premier League matches, the young Portuguese had gone some way towards winning over the many sceptics at his new club - not least those who booed their manager off at half-time against Queens Park Rangers a month ago. But this result represents a jarring reality check against a side Spurs had been expected to beat, and beat well. Three years ago Wigan had lost 9-1 here. They came back the following season to record a famous victory, the only home defeat Spurs suffered in the league that term. The brilliance of Gareth Bale decided last year's encounter in Spurs' favour, and few expected the sequence of results to continue as it did. From the off, Martinez's side were sure-footed and progressive, carving out three clear-cut chances in the first half with their incisive passing and clever movement. Tottenham's Brad Friedel was much the busier of the two goalkeepers, denying Shaun Maloney and Arouna Kone, who were tremendous throughout, with important blocks, before Watson fired over from the edge of the penalty area. Jan Vertonghen's dipping volley from a half-cleared corner represented Tottenham's best chance of a frustrating first half. Tactically smart, Wigan's work-rate was also admirable, their players often doubling up on Tottenham's main threats, such as Bale. Jermain Defoe also had unwelcome company throughout. After the break, Wigan battled for everything and dominated territory with their fast and fluent approach, taking the lead after Franco Di Santo forced a corner. Maloney curled it wickedly under Friedel's crossbar and the American goalkeeper clawed it out but only as far as Watson, who thumped the ball across the line from close-range. Wigan had scored 35 league goals since the turn of the year, but this was the first to have been scored by an Englishman. White Hart Lane fell silent. The noise only built again when Villas-Boas threw Adebayor into the fray but there was anger and disbelief in the stands as it became clear the Togo striker was to replace Defoe, rather than play alongside him. Spurs responded as Bale fired a shot that Al Habsi did well to turn to safety before James McCarthy cleared Steven Caulker's goalbound header off the line with a header of his own. A second successive home defeat in the Premier League was beckoning for the first time since September 2008. Maynor Figueroa fizzed a free-kick narrowly wide of Friedel's goal but much of the pressure was coming from Spurs now, and Gary Caldwell and Ivan Ramis were leading from the front as Wigan threw bodies in the way of Tottenham shots. Bale curled a free-kick narrowly wide in time added on but Wigan weathered the cold and Tottenham's late storm to hold on for victory.

24.04.2013 23:34:13 Robin van Persie provided a painful illustration of what Arsenal are missing as he set Manchester United on the way to a comfortable win against his former club at Old Trafford. The striker - who received a hostile reception from the fans who once idolised him, following his Â£24m summer move from Arsenal to United - was on target inside three minutes with his 10th goal of the season. United were in such command that they could even afford a missed penalty from Wayne Rooney before Patrice Evra wrapped up the victory with a second-half header. And to make matters worse on a miserable day for Arsenal and manager Arsene Wenger, Jack Wilshere was sent off with 20 minutes left after receiving a second yellow card from referee Mike Dean for an overzealous challenge on Evra. Santi Cazorla pulled a goal back for the Gunners with the final kick of the game but the scoreline was not a true reflection of United's obvious supremacy in all areas. The result put United top of the Premier League with three points collected with the minimum of fuss in the 44th meeting between Wenger and his great adversary Sir Alex Ferguson. For the visitors, defeat leaves them with 15 points from 10 games, their worst start to a Premier League season under Wenger. It may not have been the humiliation of last season's 8-2 thrashing at Old Trafford but Arsenal's manager will struggle to take any positives from this performance. Arsenal's visiting support made their contempt for one-time hero Van Persie clear when his name was announced before kick-off - but the Dutchman was soon punishing his former club as he put United ahead early on. Thomas Vermaelen set the tone for a poor display with a bad clearance that sent Rafael's cross straight into the path of Van Persie, who did not hesitate before sending a low right-foot finish past keeper Vito Mannone. It was a goal scored in close proximity to Arsenal's fans but Van Persie declined to milk the moment and his celebration was muted as he was mobbed by delighted team-mates. Van Persie almost added his second when he was played in by Rooney's angled pass but his powerful rising shot was well saved by Mannone. Arsenal were struggling desperately, a problem exemplified by the hapless Andre Santos's woeful attempts to defend their left-flank in the face of the pace and penetration of Antonio Valencia. Mannone, at least, was distinguishing himself and he did well again to block from Rooney as United continued to dominate. There had been little for Arsenal to cling to in a dismal first half but they were at least given some hope as half-time approached. Referee Dean awarded a penalty after Cazorla raised his arms to block Ashley Young's cross. Rooney stepped forward to take the kick but missed his seventh penalty out of 20 in the Premier League by shooting low and wide. Theo Walcott, surprisingly only named as substitute after his hat-trick in the 7-5 Capital One Cup win at Reading in midweek, finally entered the action after 51 minutes as a replacement for Aaron Ramsey after the Welshman injured his groin. It was the signal for the visitors to threaten at last, Olivier Giroud striking the outside of the post from an acute angle. Valencia had missed an open goal from Van Persie's pass seconds after the break and the Netherlands striker was also thwarted by another fine stop from Mannone - but it was a brief reprieve for Arsenal. Rooney took possession of a short corner and the diminutive Evra found space among Arsenal's defenders to head comfortably past Mannone after 67 minutes. The Gunners' plight worsened moments later when Wilshere, who had been combative throughout, was shown a second yellow card for a foul on Evra. He could have no complaints although his fate was in sharp contrast to Tom Cleverley, who was hastily removed by Ferguson as he ran a similar risk for a tackle on Wilshere following an earlier booking. Cazorla's fine curled finish provided nothing in the way of consolation for Arsenal as this performance demonstrated just how far they have to travel before they can even consider themselves title contenders once more.

24.04.2013 23:34:13 Manchester United closed the gap at the top of the Premier League to one point after Javier Hernandez's late winner gave them a hotly contested win over nine-man Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. David Luiz's own goal and Robin van Persie's clinical finish gave Manchester United a two-goal lead early on, but leaders Chelsea fought back superbly to level with goals from Juan Mata and Ramires either side of the interval. A pulsating game then turned on two red cards awarded against Chelsea in the space of five minutes that set the scene for substitute Hernandez to secure the three points for Sir Alex Ferguson's side. Chelsea had few complaints about Branislav Ivanovic's red card for fouling Ashley Young as he raced through, but the dismissal of Fernando Torres for diving was bitterly disputed by the home side - and they looked to have a case. The Spaniard appeared to be caught by Reds defender Jonny Evans but referee Mark Clattenburg ruled he had dived and produced a second yellow card, to the obvious astonishment of Torres and the undisguised fury of Chelsea. Substitute Hernandez then smuggled in a winner from close range but it was converted from an offside position to leave Chelsea manager Roberto Di Matteo nursing a burning sense of injustice. Objects were thrown and a steward injured as United's players celebrated - a sad conclusion to a thrilling game that ended in Chelsea's first Premier League defeat of the season. Van Persie scored a hat-trick in Arsenal's 5-3 win on his last visit to Stamford Bridge, and he was the central figure as United stunned Chelsea with a devastating opening burst. Ferguson ditched the diamond formation he has used recently and gave United natural width in the shape of the returning Antonio Valencia and Ashley Young. It yielded spectacular results early on. Young's pace allowed him to play in Wayne Rooney and when the England forward pulled the ball back Van Persie's shot ended up in the back of the net via the upright and Luiz. And before Chelsea could recover United doubled their lead as Valencia once again demonstrated his value with a fine run and cross for Van Persie to sweep a finish past Petr Cech. It was to Chelsea's credit that they managed to clear their heads and find a route back into the game. United goalkeeper David de Gea resorted to the unorthodox to kick away Luiz's free kick and Evans deflected Jon Obi Mikel's cross on to a post with De Gea wrong-footed. Chelsea deserved some reward and it came on the stroke of half-time. Rooney was booked for hauling down Eden Hazard and Mata curled home a superb free-kick. Mata was then denied once more by the excellent De Gea but Chelsea had all the momentum and they were back on level terms after 53 minutes when Ramires rose above Tom Cleverley to equalise. The game was balanced perfectly but it shifted decisively towards United when Chelsea lost two players to red cards just after the hour. Ivanovic was sent off for tripping Young as he raced on to Van Persie's pass then, far more contentiously, Torres was also dismissed for picking up a second yellow card for diving. Torres was arguably fortunate to escape a red card when he was booked for a high challenge on Cleverley but felt he had been hard done by after falling following Evans's challenge. It was a huge call by Clattenburg because it looked like Torres had been caught by Evans, but the referee was convinced the striker had dived. Chelsea's backroom staff were furious and angry words were exchanged between Ferguson and his opposite numbers as the heated debate continued. Chelsea's depleted numbers were always going to be in danger. And so it proved as United went ahead with 15 minutes remaining. Van Persie's shot was blocked by the feet of Cech but when Rafael returned the ball into the six-yard area Hernandez turned in from an offside position. United's players celebrated in a corner of Stamford Bridge but they were met by furious scenes, with objects appearing to be thrown and a steward requiring lengthy treatment. Ferguson's side closed out the win to move within striking range of Chelsea at the Premier League summit but the jeers directed at Clattenburg as he left the pitch at the final whistle demonstrated the strength of feeling inside Stamford Bridge.

24.04.2013 23:34:13 Papiss Cisse scored a dramatic stoppage-time winner as Newcastle deservedly beat Fulham to move five points clear of the relegation zone. After hitting the post and missing a number of other chances, Cisse volleyed home with one of the game's last kicks. Mid-table Fulham went close in either half through Dimitar Berbatov, but they were under pressure for long periods. Vurnon Anita shot against the bar and Yoann Gouffran also hit the post before Cisse secured victory at the death. It was the third time Newcastle had scored a stoppage-time winner in their last four Premier League games at St James' Park. But more importantly for the Magpies, it eases relegation concerns that had intensified amid a run of three defeats in four games. Fulham looked to have survived Newcastle's bombardment to escape with a point, only for their efforts to be undermined at the last. While this brings to an end their three-match unbeaten run away from home, they remain in 10th place. Martin Jol's men made the better start and Berbatov almost scored for the fifth consecutive match with a curling strike. Newcastle's attempts to establish a rhythm was hampered when left-back David Santon limped off with a hamstring problem - Alan Pardew's latest in a long list of injury concerns. To the manager's credit, he stuck with the 4-4-2 formation that paired Cisse and Gouffran up front, and his side managed to build a degree of momentum as Fulham offered little going forward. Their best chances fell to Cisse, but the Senegal striker curled narrowly wide before blazing a shot over the bar. Newcastle's profligacy seemed to give Fulham confidence and, as the first half drew to a close, it took a fine Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa block to thwart Bryan Ruiz before Tim Krul denied Stanislav Manolev. The Magpies have conceded more second-half goals than any other Premier League side bar Aston Villa, but on this occasion they found themselves encamped inside opposition territory for long periods. Anita - Santon's replacement - set the tone with a drive that was deflected on to the bar by Fulham substitute Emmanuel Frimpong, while Cisse was let down by a poor touch in front of goal. They again went close when Sylvain Marveaux's corner was headed on to a post by Gouffran - it may have touched Sascha Riether arm on the way through - and Cisse hit the same upright with the follow-up. Newcastle still looked stunned by their failure to score when Fulham went up the other end and Berbatov drew a superb diving save from Krul with a header from John Arne Riise's free-kick. Jol introduced Hugo Rodallega and he almost made an immediate impact, only to lose his balance when seemingly clean through. Although Newcastle flooded forward towards the end, their hopes appeared to die when Mark Schwarzer kept out a Cisse header. However, the front man would have one last say, controlling Yohan Cabaye's shot and reacting quickest to drill past Krul.  Fulham manager Martin Jol:  "We defended well, especially in the first half. We frustrated the crowd and that's what you want away from home. We had two or three opportunities but didn't score. "It's not easy to come here and get away with a result but today we probably should have, at least one point. It's unbelievable they [Newcastle] are in that position and a draw would have been disappointing for them. "But if you've watched us over the last three months we've done ever so well, frustrated home teams and scored at the right moment. We didn't today and that's disappointing. Conceding late is even more disappointing. "We've had a very good run and we said today we don't want to break that - getting a result here was our intention. We're disappointed."

24.04.2013 23:34:13 Papiss Cisse's deflected injury-time winner gave Newcastle a barely deserved Premier League victory against West Bromwich Albion at St James' Park. Sammy Ameobi's hopeful shot hit the back of an oblivious Cisse and flew past stranded away keeper Ben Foster. Romelu Lukaku's header looked to have maintained Albion's fine start to the season, equalising Demba Ba's volley. But Cisse's first league goal of the season helped Newcastle move into the top half with a first win in five. It left eighth-placed Albion still searching for their first away win of the campaign, despite their best start to a top-flight season since 1983. Meanwhile Cisse, who scored 13 goals in his first 14 Premier League matches last season, will be hoping the lucky break can help him rediscover his goalscoring touch. Albion boss Steve Clarke watched his attack-minded side succumb to two late goals in the 2-1 defeat by Manchester City last weekend, but promised his side would retain their offensive outlook on Tyneside. And they looked more likely to go on and score a second-half winner than their hosts, who lacked creativity and too often carelessly gave away possession. Despite making nine changes from Thursday's Europa League win against Club Bruges, Newcastle looked like a team which was mentally tired following their midweek outing. Belgium international Lukaku was making only his second top-flight start for the Baggies, in place of top scorer Shane Long, after impressing in a substitute appearance last weekend. And the on-loan Chelsea striker repaid Clarke's faith with a powerful performance against the Magpies. He was a constant menace to the home defence and, despite passing up two glorious first-half opportunities when he was denied by home keeper Tim Krul, levelled after he was picked out by Zoltan Gera's delightful chip. It had been Newcastle who, after a sedate start, carved out the first chance of the game when Shola Ameobi flighted a lovely curling cross into the path of strike partner Ba, who planted a diving far-post header wide. But Senegal striker Ba did manage to grab his seventh goal in nine Premier League games this season before half-time. It came from a 'route one' move, Krul's goal-kick flicked on by Shola Ameobi, and helped on further by Gareth McAuley's wayward header into the path of Ba, who spun smartly to volley past Foster. Albion always looked to threaten on the counter-attack and could have had the opener themselves before Ba struck. They poured forward quickly following a Newcastle corner and Lukaku, who raced on to a well weighted through-ball from Graham Dorrans, drew an instinctive save from Krul. Moments later, he again failed to beat the Dutch keeper in another one-on-one. Lukaku was replaced by Long midway through the second half and the Republic of Ireland striker twice came close to scoring from low crosses before Albion were hit by Cisse's lucky late winner.  Newcastle manager Alan Pardew:  "You've got to feel for West Brom today because they have played well. I thought first half we just shaded it and second half we lost our way. "But our work rate was great and in the end we got a break. To be honest we haven't had too many breaks this season. We've had a lot of injuries and haven't moaned about it. "This Thursday to Sunday run is proving difficult. We got tired because of our efforts this week. We make a lot of changes but it is still has an effect emotionally."  West Bromwich Albion head coach Steve Clarke:  "I certainly didn't think it would be a game we were going to lose. I thought we had good control in the first half and created good chances. "I felt we were unfortunate to be behind at half-time. It was a horrible moment, a big deflection in injury time and it's in the back of the net. "After the late goals we conceded last week [in the defeat by Manchester City], it's hard to take."

24.04.2013 23:34:13 Tottenham Hotspur survived a Southampton fightback to go fourth in the Premier League. In a one-sided first half, Spurs coasted to a 2-0 lead thanks to Gareth Bale's bouncing header and Clint Dempsey bundling over the line. But Saints improved after half-time and got back in the game when Jay Rodriguez finished from a tight angle. Rodriguez and the recalled Rickie Lambert had chances to equalise, but Spurs held on. The prospect of anything other than a Tottenham win - their first in five visits to St Mary's - looked non-existent at the end of a first period when Southampton's defensive limitations were all too evident. But, after managing a first shot on Brad Friedel's goal shortly after the interval, the hosts were transformed, creating problems for a Spurs defence that had previously enjoyed a comfortable afternoon. It was still a shock when Rodriguez pulled a goal back for Nigel Adkins's side. Maya Yoshida was somehow denied on the Spurs goalline by William Gallas and, from the resulting corner, Rodriguez's flick was well saved by Friedel, before the former Burnley man put away the rebound via the post. Rodriguez fired wide and Lambert was blocked by Gallas as Saints got on top in the period that followed, but Andre Villas-Boas's side held on to collect three points and bounce back from last week's defeat by Chelsea.  In contrast, Adkins is left to reflect on Saints' seventh defeat of the season, one created by the poor defending that has characterised their return to the Premier League. Southampton had conceded 24 goals in their opening eight games - the most in the top flight since Wolves in 1963 - and they were again ripped apart as Spurs poured forward in the first half. Finding space down both flanks, particularly with Kyle Walker overlapping Aaron Lennon on the right, the visitors looked dangerous every time they entered the Saints half. It was a long ball down the Spurs right that created the opening goal, with Jermain Defoe cutting in to find Tom Huddlestone, whose floated cross was met by Bale's downward header, which bounced into the left-hand corner of Artur Boruc's net. The goal marked Bale's return both to the Tottenham side and to Southampton, the club he left as a 17-year-old in 2007. The Welshman, who missed his side's last two games following the birth of his first child, did not celebrate. Although Saints kept the ball well they were not troubling an organised Spurs defence and the question seemed to be when, rather than if, Villas-Boas's men would double their lead. So it proved, as Lennon was able to run unchallenged from deep inside his own half, before playing a defence-splitting ball into the path of Defoe. The England striker rolled the ball past Boruc, and the retreating Jose Fonte hacked his second attempt at a clearance into Dempsey, with the ball rebounding off the American into the net. And the visitors would have been out of sight had Defoe not then wasted three chances, all originating from the Spurs right. On each occasion he failed to find the target when given time and space to shoot, but it looked to be of no consequence until the Southampton resurgence. As it was, Spurs had just done enough.  Tottenham manager Andre Villas-Boas: "It is good for the team to win a difficult game away at Southampton. The first half was extremely good in terms of the football we played. In the second half we had to change the nature of the game, we had to defend much more. "We're extremely happy for what we did. We played on Thursday and we don't have a lot of players to rotate the squad for all the competitions we want to do well in. "It's fantastic to see them perform at this level when only a few hours ago we had a game in Slovenia. "We certainly wanted to get six points from this fixture and the next game against Wigan at home, before we play Manchester City and Arsenal. That week could be important in terms of what we want to do in the league."

24.04.2013 23:34:13 Luis Suarez took centre stage as Liverpool and Everton shared the points after a pulsating 90 minutes in the 219th Merseyside derby. The Uruguayan was controversially denied an injury-time winner after Everton had fought back from 2-0 down, but it was an earlier goal celebration which is likely to prove the game's enduring image. Having played a key role in Liverpool's opener with a shot that deflected in off Leighton Baines, Suarez ran to celebrate with a swallow dive in front of David Moyes - a reference to claims by the Everton manager before the game that he went down too easily.  Suarez added Liverpool's second with a deft header four minutes later only for Everton to score twice before half-time through Leon Osman and Steven Naismith. The result leaves Everton in fifth and extends Liverpool's unbeaten run to four matches. At the final whistle, they could give no more. Everton and Liverpool had fought each other to a standstill, matching each other step for step and, ultimately, goal for goal. If the clocks had not quite gone back 25 years to the days when Peter Reid and Steve McMahon slugged it out in midfield, Steven Gerrard and Marouane Fellaini, an adopted Scouser, still refused to give each other the time to exhibit their playmaking skills. Much of the talk before the game had centred on Everton's best start to a Premier League campaign since they qualified for the Champions League places in 2004-05, but Moyes had made the headlines by claiming Suarez consistently went down too easily. In the 14th minute, the Reds striker pounced on a loose ball to the right of the Everton penalty box and sent in a low shot that deflected in at the near post off Baines's leg. Suarez turned for the dugouts to celebrate, pointing in Moyes's direction before throwing himself into the air in a swallow dive and landing on the touchline in front of the Everton manager. The Scot stormed out of his seat and a number of items were thrown on to the field in the minutes after the goal, but more drama was to come. Five minutes later, Suarez scored a second Liverpool goal. Sterling won a disputed free-kick, Gerrard curled a delightful ball onto the head of his striker and Suarez applied the glancing blow that took the ball beyond Blues keeper Tim Howard into the net. The celebration was more traditional this time but Goodison was stunned. The home support had no time to catch its breath, however, as Everton surged forward driven on by their manager. Nikica Jelavic combined with Fellaini to win a corner, and Brad Jones could only punch it to the edge of his penalty area where Osman thumped it back across the Liverpool goalkeeper and into the net. Everton drew hope, and with it purpose and penetration, as Phil Neville and Osman started to dominate the midfield battle. Kevin Mirallas was tormenting Andre Wisdom down the Everton left, creating one chance for Fellaini and another for himself as Goodison now bounced with optimism. It was no surprise when the equaliser arrived shortly after the half-hour. Mirallas surged forward again, but his cross hit Fellaini. The Belgian gathered the loose ball and sent another cross into the middle where Naismith arrived to score his first goal for Everton. Liverpool were being overrun and Rodgers required a major reshuffle at the break. A switch to three at the back allowed his side the spare man in midfield but it was the decision to thrust Sterling into a central attacking role alongside Suarez that caused Everton a bigger problem. The 17-year-old's pace was an immediate issue, as he broke beyond Phil Jagielka only to skew his shot wide with just Howard to beat. But Everton kept coming too. Fellaini headed wide and Jelavic came within a big toe of an Everton third as he stretched to reach Seamus Coleman's low cross, before inexplicably heading Baines's free kick-wide from six yards. Suarez was never far from the action in his role as pantomime villain, receiving a booking for treading on the back of Sylvain Distin's leg. Liverpool came again and thought they had snatched a winner when Gerrard's free-kick was headed down by Sebastian Coates and prodded in by Suarez. The red half of Merseyside began to celebrate but the linesman's flag was raised, replays showed incorrectly, and the points were shared.

24.04.2013 23:34:13 Manchester City stuttered to an unconvincing win over a battling Swansea in the longest game in Premier League history. Carlos Tevez's stunner rescued Roberto Mancini's team as they followed up their midweek European disappointment with another lacklustre display. Keeper Joe Hart had kept the hosts in the game with two saves from Michu. But Tevez's 30-yard strike on the hour gave the hosts the three points and sent the champions second in the table. Both managers, however, will be concerned as each had a star player carried off on a stretcher, Swans goalkeeper Michel Vorm and Blues defender Micah Richards suffering worrying injuries. Each required lengthy treatment on the field, racking up a record 12 minutes of added time. But a match in which Manchester City extended their unbeaten home league run to 34 games will be remembered for little else, Mancini's men still seeming shaken from their midweek European capitulation at Ajax. Tevez's clinical brilliance was the difference as Swansea enjoyed the better openings but the hosts had the ability to penetrate. Mancini's side had an alert Richards to thank early on as he cleared a dangerous right-wing Hernandez cross with Swansea top-scorer Michu lurking. The Spanish striker suffered a blow to the head as the England right-back headed the ball away and Michu, worryingly, lay motionless for a couple of minutes. But Michu recovered and showed no ill effects as 10 minutes later he put the ball in the home side's net. The effort, however, was disallowed because he was offside when Wayne Routledge played the through ball. That chance came just moments after visiting keeper Vorm almost gifted their hosts an opening goal. Vorm's poor clearance fell straight to Sergio Aguero and as the Argentine striker set up countryman Tevez, Swans defender Chico Flores stepped in to clear the danger. Vorm, though, did not make a telling save until the 38th minute when the Dutch international kept out Tevez's 15-yard drive - a statistic that would concern Blues boss Mancini. And the anxiety around the Etihad deepened as Swansea wasted two glorious chances to put themselves ahead in the final 10 minutes of the first half. Hernandez failed to capitalise when set free in the box before Michu was also unable to convert Ki Sung-Yueng's defence-splitting pass as England international Hart smothered his toe-poke. Mancini's side responded to the half-time Etihad boos, Aguero firing wide within 18 seconds of the restart. Mario Balotelli, a half-time replacement for the injured Aleksandar Kolarov, also had a sight of goal as the hosts stepped up the pressure. The Italy international could not get to right-back Richards's low driven cross, although Balotelli wanted a penalty as he claimed Chico pulled his shirt. Swansea, though, did give their expensively assembled rivals a warning as Hart again denied Michu from a header. But Tevez ended his eight-game goal drought with a moment of magic, a swerving strike that left Vorm helpless as the ball flew into the bottom right-hand corner of his net. Vorm was injured in the process and was carried off on a stretcher nursing his groin. Moments later, Richards too required a stretcher after collapsing holding his knee with no-one else near him.

24.04.2013 23:34:13 Mikel Arteta's late winner ended bottom-club Queens Park Rangers' resistance as Arsenal finished a turbulent week with a vital victory. Arteta poked in from close range after hitting the bar, as the returning Jack Wilshere helped Arsenal bounce back from defeats by Norwich and Schalke.  The winner came moments after QPR's Stephane Mbia was sent off for kicking out at Arsenal's Thomas Vermaelen. QPR's Esteban Granero and Jamie Mackie spurned good injury-time chances. England midfielder Wilshere played 67 minutes as he made his first senior Arsenal appearance for 17 months. It has been a tough week for Arsene Wenger after his side's surprise defeats by Premier League strugglers Norwich and Champions League visitors Schalke were followed by a spiky annual shareholders' meeting, where fans questioned the club's ambitions. But Arteta's winner, which came after Hoops keeper Julio Cesar magnificently saved Olivier Giroud's header at the start of a goalmouth scramble, moves Arsenal into fourth in the Premier League table. It was harsh on Brazilian Cesar who produced several superb saves to keep out the Gunners as the crowd grew increasingly restless inside the Emirates. Ultimately the game turned on the sending-off of Rangers defender Mbia, who was shown a red card by referee Anthony Taylor when he senselessly kicked out at Vermaelen while lying on the ground having already won a free-kick. The defeat leaves QPR still searching for their first league win of the season and bottom of the table. But manager Mark Hughes can take huge positives from a compact defensive display that only unravelled after Mbia's dismissal. In their next three matches, Hughes's team face Reading, Stoke and Southampton - all teams in the bottom half - and will take heart from their brave display. Even after they were reduced to 10 men and fell a goal behind, the visitors refused to give up and perhaps should have had an equaliser through either Granero or Mackie. Former Real Madrid midfielder Granero skewed wide after he was put clean through, before Mackie powered through a parting Arsenal defence only to prod his shot straight at Vito Mannone. Wilshere's return aside, pre-match attention was focused on QPR substitute Anton Ferdinand's decision to wear a T-shirt in support of anti-racism group Kick It Out during the warm-up. Ferdinand - found by the FA to have been racially abused by John Terry - had chosen not to wear one last weekend and, in a joint statement released with brother Rio, has urged the organisation to do more to stamp racism out of football. The Gunners' man in the spotlight was Wilshere and, after his first touch was greeted with huge cheers, he looked the likeliest player to unlock QPR with his neat touches and inventive play. Aaron Ramsey's free header looped on to the Hoops crossbar, before Wilshere's stinging 20-yard shot was spilled by Cesar. However, QPR continued to pose a threat on the counter attack, particularly down the flanks where they sought to expose the space left by the Gunners' attacking full-backs Sagna and Andre Santos. Brazil international Santos endured a testing night against Schalke and his perceived vulnerability was targeted by pacy QPR pair Shaun Wright-Phillips and Jose Bosingwa. Bosingwa failed to pick out the waiting Bobby Zamora as Vermaelen came to the rescue, while Wright-Phillips spooned a cross wide from another promising position. Arsenal's frustrations were typified by Santi Cazorla wastefully smashing an inviting half-volley over the QPR bar before Arteta clinched a vital win.  Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger:  "It was a good game overall. We played against a QPR side which has quality. "We played quite well but lacked a little bit of the confidence you miss when you have lost two games. We had chances before the sending-off but it made it easier [for us] and more difficult for Rangers. "A draw would have been a big disappointment, but if we had lost today it would have been a crisis."  QPR manager Mark Hughes:  "I've come with teams on many occasions to the Emirates and that was as comfortable a game at the Emirates as I've been involved in. "We were in total control, never under real pressure and they only created one chance when Cazorla ballooned the ball over the bar. "We were making substitutions with a view to win the game because that was the extent of the control we thought we had. But the sending-off put us on the back foot, although even then I thought our response was magnificent and we had chances to win the game."

24.04.2013 23:34:13 Hal Robson-Kanu's last-minute goal clinched a point for struggling Reading after a riveting encounter with Fulham. A thunderous drive from Mikele Leigertwood gave the Royals a deserved half-time lead. But Fulham fought back to go ahead through substitute Bryan Ruiz and Chris Baird before Garath McCleary got Reading back on level terms. Dimitar Berbatov's low shot looked to have snatched the win for Fulham, but Robson-Kanu poked home at the death. The result leaves 18th-placed Reading still searching for their first Premier League win of the season, while Fulham move into sixth. The west Londoners even had their sights on the top four when they went 2-1 and 3-2 ahead, only to be pegged back both times by their spirited hosts. Reading could then have taken all three points themselves, but a double save from Fulham goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer denied them a stoppage-time winner. The Royals controlled the first hour of the match, creating a chance after just three minutes when a cross from Nicky Shorey was headed wastefully wide by Pavel Pogrebnyak. After an otherwise dull opening 25 minutes, the game exploded into life when Leigertwood drove home a fine opener. Captain Jobi McAnuff was the provider as he cut inside from the left flank and squared for Leigertwood, whose first-time strike flew into the top corner. Fulham spurned a clear opportunity to equalise when Damien Duff's cross from the right picked out Hugo Rodallega but his header from six yards was directed straight at keeper Alex McCarthy. The onus was on Fulham to start the second half brightly but their forward play lacked pace or urgency, prompting Berbatov to make his frustrations clear with several gestures towards his team-mates. Manager Martin Jol had seen enough and, after 58 minutes, brought off Rodallega and replaced him with the unpredictable Ruiz. It proved an inspired move as the Costa Rican forward exchanged passes with Duff and unleashed a curling shot past McCarthy from the edge of the box. Defender Baird, Fulham's match-winner against Aston Villa in their last game, looked set to be the hero once again as he put them in front with a glancing header from Ruiz's corner. But Reading got back on terms when Adam Le Fondre crossed for his fellow substitute McCleary to slot past Schwarzer. Ex-Reading midfielder Steve Sidwell was the next replacement to have a decisive influence as he threaded a perfect pass through to Berbatov, who lashed home his third goal since moving from Manchester United to give Fulham the lead. Reading were not be denied, however, and equalised again from their next attack. Shorey's clipped free-kick from the left landed in a crowd of players in the six-yard box and dropped for Robson-Kanu to bundle the ball home from point-blank range.  Reading manager Brian McDermott: "At 3-2 my weekend was absolutely miserable, but at 3-3 we were trying to kick on and win. It was a strange game - that's the fourth time we've taken the lead in this league and we need to finish the job off. "All we can do is talk about the game and playing our football, doing what we have to do and if we do that the win will come. "We try to win games and that's what we've done here for two or three years. The players derserve an awful lot of respect for getting back into that."  Fulham boss Martin Jol: "Berbatov was good. He can play in midfield, in the hole and up front. "He needed an injection to play the second half and showed a lot of character. "There was a problem with his rib which was very painful. Maybe it was broken, we'll have to take a look at it. "We asked him to play on for 10 or 15 minutes but he stayed on the pitch and it was good to see him score the third goal."

24.04.2013 23:34:13 Sunderland were denied a penalty in a goalless encounter with fellow draw specialists Stoke. The hosts were the better side but were lucky to escape when Robert Huth handled Steven Fletcher's second-half shot at the Britannia. Black Cats keeper Simon Mignolet produced a double save to deny Stoke's Charlie Adam and Ryan Shawcross before the interval. Stoke lost Marc Wilson, who was taken to hospital with a broken leg. Play was held up for five minutes early in the second half while the defender received treatment on the pitch, before he was eventually carried off on a stretcher and replaced by Andy Wilkinson. It summed up a frustrating day for the hosts, who have now drawn six of their first nine league games, the same tally as Sunderland, who have played a game fewer. While the visitors will argue they should have had a penalty for Huth's intervention, Martin O'Neill's side created few chances and have now won only once in 16 league outings. Quality was in short supply in an opening 45 minutes littered with misplaced passes. The first-half highlight was a terrific double save by Mignolet to deny the Potters the breakthrough. The Belgian did well to punch Charlie Adam's curling free-kick away but the ball fell to Ryan Shawcross who then forced Mignolet into a diving stop. Sunderland, who arrived in the Potteries without an away win in the Premier League since they visited the Britannia on 4 February, failed to force Asmir Begovic into a serious save before the interval - although Stoke's Bosnian keeper had to be alert to cut out Craig Gardner's dangerous low cross before it reached Jack Colback. The game, scrappy and disjointed in the first half, threatened to become a bruising affair in the second when former Black Cats midfielder Dean Whitehead was responsible for an ugly challenge on Sebastian Larsson, earning the Stoke man a yellow card. The match finally came to life in the closing stages, Fletcher's shot striking Huth on the arm inside the Stoke area. But referee Mark Halsey was not interested and Huth responded by forcing a save from Mignolet with a header, while Michael Kightly spurned another Stoke chance in the sixth minute of stoppage time.  Stoke manager Tony Pulis:  "I think a big thing today is that having gone to Manchester United and defended so poorly last week (in a 4-2 defeat), we actually looked really solid. "I don't think Asmir Begovic has had a shot to save. So that has been a bonus, but we just need a break in front of goal."  Sunderland manager Martin O'Neill said:  "I've seen it back briefly (the penalty appeal). The truth is, I thought if it had been given against us, I might have been none too pleased. "I think he has tried to keep his arm there, although if it misses him, it is in the net. I'm not sure it was a deliberate handball." "It was a difficult game played in difficult enough conditions, with the wind swirling around. "We have drawn a lot of games this season and we are just unable at the moment to turn one or two of those draws into victories."

24.04.2013 23:34:13 Wigan notched a first home win of the season with a typically slick passing display against a sloppy West Ham. Ivan Ramis gave the Latics an early lead with a magnificent volley straight from Jean Beausejour's corner. James McArthur grabbed the hosts' deserved second with a 15-yard strike after Jussi Jaaskelainen's poor kick. West Ham could have gone fourth with a win, but they failed to trouble Wigan keeper Ali Al-Habsi until James Tomkins headed a late consolation. The Hammers began the day 10 places above their hosts in the table, but the outcome rarely looked in doubt after Ramis's brilliant eighth-minute strike. Roberto Martinez's Wigan side, without a league win since August, grew in confidence after the goal and their rhythm was rarely interrupted by the visitors. The Hammers repeatedly gifted possession to the home side as their promising early-season form deserted them. This had been billed as a match of contrasting styles - Martinez's elegant passing game versus Sam Allardyce's percentage football - so Wigan seemed to be going against type when they scored their opener from a set piece. It was, however, the most spectacular of set pieces. Beausejour sent in a corner and Ramis was allowed to drift unmarked to a position 14 yards out, from where he unleashed an unstoppable left-footed strike past Jaaskelainen. The Spanish defender, who had agreed terms with West Ham before opting to join Wigan from Mallorca in the summer, also hit a wonder strike against the Hammers in a 4-1 League Cup win last month. The game then settled into its predicted pattern: the Latics knocked the ball around sweetly while the visitors pumped it forward in search of Andy Carroll's head. The home side's tactic looked more effective, with James McCarthy, Shaun Maloney and Beausejour all going close. Carroll got a first sight of goal just before half-time when he headed Tomkins' cross wide, but the Hammers' hopes of mounting a second-half fightback were snuffed out within two minutes of the restart. A woeful clearance from Jaaskelainen gifted Wigan possession and they took full advantage. Maloney helped Beausejour's pass on to McArthur, who slammed home from the edge of the box to double the lead. The Latics were happy to soak up West Ham pressure for the remainder of the match, but the Hammers toiled without reward and Carroll cut a frustrated figure. When his opportunity finally arrived from an accurate Matt Jarvis cross midway through the second half, the England striker's control let him down. In fact, Allardyce's side failed to muster a clear attempt on goal until the final minutes when Tomkins's close-range volley hit the bar. The young defender did get on the scoresheet moments later with a simple header from George McCartney's cross, but there was little time to push for what would have been a scarcely deserved leveller. There was a sense of relief in the Wigan ranks at the final whistle as the Latics celebrated a belated return to the form they showed at the tail-end of last season. A win would have sent West Ham into a Champions League position, but with games against Manchester City, Manchester United, Tottenham and Chelsea in the coming weeks, this defeat could provide a reality check on their ambitions.  Wigan manager Roberto Martinez:  "We don't get too many goals from set plays, but it was a tremendous finish from Ivan Ramis. "That early goal set the tone of the game and allowed us to control it. "I really enjoyed the performance. We have been showing flashes of our ability but today we were really good. "Our philosophy and way of playing will never change."  West Ham manager Sam Allardyce:  "It was a bit of a push on Winston Reid for their first goal, but it was a brilliant volley. And they deserved to win. "We didn't play any football today, we didn't get past half-decent.  I'm disappointed our performance has reduced to such a level. "It wasn't about Wigan today, it was about us not using the ability we've got. We can't keep giving the ball back to them." "We were not good enough, in any shape or form. Our problems were all over the pitch."

24.04.2013 23:34:13 Michael Turner's header earned Norwich City a point and denied 10-man Aston Villa victory in manager Paul Lambert's first meeting with his old club. Lambert, who left City in acrimonious circumstances in the summer, saw his side take a first-half lead through Christian Benteke's cool finish. But the game turned seven minutes after the break when Villa's Joe Bennett was sent off for a second booking. And, after sustained pressure, Turner's header earned a deserved draw. Relentless second-half Norwich domination had threatened to overwhelm a Villa side who had taken the lead against the run of play. And Lambert will be relieved to earn a draw, even though it means Villa's start to the season is the club's poorest to a campaign for 43 years and leaves them hovering just above the Premier League relegation zone. Although the vast majority of the pre-match build-up had concentrated on Lambert's Carrow Road exit, he had insisted this was "just another game". The Scot and Norwich are both suing each other for breach of contract and the matter is to be decided by a Premier League managers' tribunal. But the apathy with which the Norwich fans greeted Lambert suggested their main feeling was of respect and gratitude to a man who had won them two promotions and masterminded such an impressive first season back in the top flight. And with just one win apiece from a combined total of 16 league games, and both sides struggling, neither team could afford to be distracted. Heavy defeats against Liverpool and Chelsea had left Canaries fans preparing for a miserable season, but last Saturday's fine 1-0 win over Arsenal seemed to have renewed their belief and an unchanged side looked busy, confident and dangerous in the opening stages. Grant Holt, the matchwinner against the Gunners, led the line impressively and he and the busy Wes Hoolahan posed constant problems for a reshuffled and injury-ravaged Villa defence. Hoolahan should have put the visitors ahead when sent through by Holt's clever pass, but keeper Brad Guzan came out quickly to make a decent block with his feet. Villa appeared nervous, struggling to retain possession, and their edginess was beginning to transmit itself to the home support. But they took the lead with their first meaningful attack on 27 minutes after a mix-up involving both Norwich centre-backs. Sebastien Bassong and Turner allowed Benteke too much space and the striker, who was preferred to Darren Bent up front, sent keeper John Ruddy the wrong way with a calmly slotted finish after good work by Joe Bennett. Lambert's side finally settled and briefly threatened to build on their lead. Benteke had a header comfortably saved after the interval, but when Joe Bennett was dismissed after picking up a second caution for blocking Elliott Bennett, Norwich seized complete control. The excellent Hoolahan went close on a couple of occasions, Holt was denied by Guzan when through one on one, and only some inspired Villa defending - particularly from Ron Vlaar - kept the visitors at bay. But finally the pressure told and Hoolahan was inevitably involved in the equaliser, finding the head of Turner with a delightful right-wing cross following a quickly taken short corner. More Norwich chances followed but Guzan made several decent saves, defenders blocked a series of long-range efforts and Villa were able to hold on.  Aston Villa manager Paul Lambert:  "I think the sending off changed a lot. That changed the game. "At first thought I thought it was a sending off, because when you commit a foul and you go to do something, then you put yourself in a position where you can get the red. "But, looking at it again, I think Elliott, too, has had hold of Joe. It was a bit of an even contest and I think the two of them were at it. "I haven't had the chance to talk to the ref [Phil Dowd] about it yet. I've only just watched a tape of it. But I thought the team were brilliant with the way they defended strongly after that. "Will Villa will be okay? I have great belief we'll be totally fine."  Norwich City manager Chris Hughton:  "I think it was two points that got away. When you are 1-0 down, you are delighted to get back in the game. "If it's 0-0 and you have the pressure we had at the end, you are more disappointed. "You can look at the game apart from possession, balance of play and amount of ball in the final third, as one of three clearcut chances. "They had one and Benteke put it away. We had two with Wes Hoolahan and Grant Holt and we didn't but I thought having gone down 1-0, we came out second half with a good attitude and forced the issue. "I think I would have been confident enough we would have got back in the game even with 11 men."

24.04.2013 23:34:13 Queens Park Rangers failed to secure a first Premier League win of the season, despite enjoying a man advantage during a breathless finale at Loftus Road. Everton held firm after controversially losing Steven Pienaar to a second yellow card with 30 minutes remaining. QPR had snatched a second-minute lead when Junior Hoilett ran 60 yards and found the net with a deflected shot. Everton struck back through a Julio Cesar own goal and both sides might also have been awarded penalties. The result leaves QPR bottom of the Premier League table and manager Mark Hughes under growing pressure. Having left Fulham, who are eighth, on the grounds they failed to match his aspirations, the Welshman would surely take survival even at this early stage of the season. Given his predicament, keeping his job for the next few weeks may be a more immediate target, but with the next league game away to Arsenal there is little sign of respite. With confidence wavering and the Loftus Road crowd in need of something to shout about, QPR came flying out of the traps, catching Everton cold. The visitors won two early corners but from the second Rangers broke with the kind of pace and purpose their attacking play has often lacked this season. Hoilett surged down the centre of the field, holding off the challenge of Phil Neville before unleashing a low shot that clipped the heel of Leighton Baines and looped beyond the wrong-footed Everton goalkeeper Tim Howard. The goal energised QPR, their passing improved and for 30 minutes they dictated. Adel Taarabt produced his usual array of tricks, Ryan Nelsen - preferred to Anton Ferdinand in defence - headed a corner over and Bobby Zamora caused havoc. But Everton are a formidable outfit and their sheer physicality enabled them to gain a foothold on the game, with the tireless Jelavic a constant threat. The Croatian tested QPR goalkeeper Cesar with a low free-kick early on and he won another from which Everton struck back. Baines' free-kick 10 yards into the Rangers half was lifted towards an unmarked Sylvain Distin five yards from goal. The Frenchman headed the ball onto the base of the post and it bounced back on to Cesar and back over the line. Such is the fragility of confidence at Loftus Road that QPR briefly went to pieces. Within 90 seconds of the goal, Everton might have struck twice more. First QPR midfielder Stephane Mbia appeared to trip Jelavic in the penalty area before Phil Jagielka headed a corner against the crossbar, having been granted the freedom of the penalty area. Everton were snapping into the challenges now, no more so than Pienaar. The South African was shown a first yellow card five minutes into the second half, was warned for a challenge on Hoilett soon after and was unfairly shown a second yellow by referee Jon Moss on 61 minutes after colliding with Jose Bosingwa.  Moyes's side were far from finished, however. A curling Baines corner once again caused havoc in the QPR defence, with Jagielka twice going close in a scramble. Spaces were beginning to appear in the Everton defence. Hoilett skipped past Leon Osman only to see his fizzing low shot turned away by Howard. The former Blackburn winger was leading QPR's charge now, with his fearless running and willingness to shoot on sight. He tested Howard again moments later before going down under a mistimed challenge by Seamus Coleman in the penalty area. QPR's penalty appeals were waved away and Everton held firm to earn a point.  QPR manager Mark Hughes: "We made an excellent start and got our reward. Junior Hoilett made things happen and I thought he was excellent all game. "All in all it was a decent game and we are just a little disappointed in so much as we have not got three points. "We are getting better and I think everyone can see that. The frustration I think is that we haven't got the points to back up the performances. "We have shown against almost every team we have played against that we can compete in this league. That gives us comfort because we know we have good players in the building and they are getting fitter."

24.04.2013 23:34:13 Gylfi Sigurdsson scored a late equaliser for Tottenham against Everton to cap a riveting match between two Champions League hopefuls. Spurs took the lead after just 33 seconds when Emmanuel Adebayor converted Jan Vertonghen's low cross. But Everton levelled through Phil Jagielka and took the lead from a fine solo goal by Kevin Mirallas. In a frantic finale, Adebayor struck the post and Sigurdsson slotted home the rebound to claim a vital point. There was still time for Everton to go close as Victor Anichebe ran through on goal and saw his shot smothered by Spurs keeper Hugo Lloris. But a draw seemed a fair result after a spirited attacking performance from two sides making light of the absence of some of their most creative players. Tottenham, deprived of injured trio Gareth Bale, Aaron Lennon and Jermain Defoe, found plenty of flair from Mousa Dembele, Sigurdsson and a rejuvenated Adebayor. And Everton, who were missing the suspended Marouane Fellaini and Steven Pienaar, were once again indebted to the superb Mirallas, whose goal was every bit as eye-catching as his stunning solo winner against Stoke last weekend. It was the home side who started the sharper, however, with their quickest goal in more than 12 years. Vertonghen's whipped low cross from the left flank eluded two Everton players and found Adebayor, who stretched out a leg to steer the ball past Tim Howard. Everton were then presented with their first opportunity by Michael Dawson. The Spurs centre-half's pass was intercepted by Leon Osman, who steadied himself before curling a right-footed effort narrowly wide of the far post. They did not have long to wait for their equaliser, a Baines corner after 15 minutes picking out Jagielka, who climbed above Vertonghen to head the ball through Lloris's legs. Watched by former star Paul Gascoigne, Tottenham enjoyed more of the ball for the remainder of the half without creating many clear openings. They appealed for a penalty before half-time when Clint Dempsey's cross appeared to strike Darron Gibson's arm but replays suggested the ball struck him on the shoulder. Everton began the second half on the front foot and had already gone close through Gibson when a moment of brilliance from Mirallas gave the visitors the lead. The agile Belgian darted inside from the right, skipped past Scott Parker and Steven Caulker and placed a shot into the far corner. Mirallas's effort was almost cancelled out by his countryman Dembele moments later, the midfielder's strike taking a deflection off John Heitinga before being parried onto the underside of the bar by Tim Howard. Suddenly the game was alive with defenders tackling and blocking desperately at either end. For Spurs, the lively Adebayor worked some space in the area but stuck straight at Howard and Dempsey curled a shot around the post. With Everton's players defending deep inside their own half, the Toffees looked on course for three points as the game entered the final five minutes. But inspiration arrived for Tottenham in the form of right-back Kyle Walker. Sprinting down the wing, he cut the ball back for Adebayor, whose curling effort stuck the post and rolled across goal for Sigurdsson to tap home. The intervention of Lloris to deny Anichebe proved just as crucial as Spurs sealed a point that keeps them in touch with Champions League rivals Chelsea and Arsenal.

24.04.2013 23:34:13 Demba Ba's late own goal rescued a point for Sunderland against 10-man Newcastle United in the North-East derby at the Stadium of Light. Newcastle successfully protected Yohan Cabaye's third-minute goal until four minutes from time - despite having Cheick Tiote sent off midway through the first half for a high challenge on Sunderland striker Steven Fletcher. Sunderland's response to their numerical advantage was desperately poor and lacked any semblance of real creation until Seb Larsson's free-kick was headed on to Ba by John O'Shea, a crucial deflection that wrong-footed Newcastle goalkeeper Tim Krul. The Black Cats then pressed forward for a late winner but a point was the least Newcastle deserved for the way they remained organised and kept Sunderland at arm's length despite losing the influential Tiote, with defender Fabricio Coloccini magnificent. It was only when the Argentine succumbed to cramp late on that Sunderland applied any real pressure on Newcastle to force the equaliser. Magpies manager Alan Pardew clenched his fist to their travelling fans at the final whistle but he may even be disappointed at not holding out for what would have been a memorable victory. Sunderland have now won only one of their last 16 games against their local rivals and they rarely looked like improving that record until that late rally. In a predictably fevered atmosphere, the visitors' nerves were settled and Sunderland's anxiety increased as Pardew's side struck early. Ba's shot was turned out by the feet of Sunderland keeper Simon Mignolet and Cabaye arrived in a crowded penalty area to drive home a low finish. Sunderland struggled to find any composure, in sharp contrast to Newcastle's more measured approach, and Cabaye was a threat once more as his long-range shot was turned over by Mignolet. The atmosphere inevitably placed this game permanently on the edge and it boiled over after 25 minutes when Tiote was sent off by referee Martin Atkinson. He had already won a free-kick after being pulled by Jack Colback but left his foot in high on Fletcher and Atkinson swiftly produced the red card. Sunderland, whose attempts to bring Adam Johnson's talents to bear had been frustrated by close marking, were buoyed by Newcastle being reduced to 10 men, but the visitors were still the better side. Johnson did escape the constant attention to send a curling shot wide and Craig Gardner was narrowly off target - but even with only 10 men Sunderland failed to seriously test keeper Tim Krul in the first half. Newcastle did make an adjustment after Tiote's sending off, introducing James Perch for Shola Ameobi, and they almost snatched a second as half-time approached but Ba sent a bicycle kick wide from eight yards. The hosts made no further headway after the break and it was no surprise when O'Neill introduced Louis Saha for the ineffective Stephane Sessegnon just after the hour. There was a rare moment of anxiety for Newcastle with 19 minutes left when Krul failed to cling on to James McClean's cross but Coloccini was once more perfectly positioned to rescue his keeper. Newcastle had been content to play a game of containment, and did it quite successfully, but they almost snatched a second on the break when Ba raced on to Cabaye's pass but could not get proper contact on his finish. As the game entered its last 10 minutes Sunderland finally fashioned a clear opportunity but Saha could only volley into the side-netting at the far post. Newcastle's grip on the game had loosened after the departure of Coloccini through injury, the arrival of Steven Taylor producing a predictably hostile reaction after his public claim that no Sunderland player would get into the Magpies team. And it was amid such confusion that Sunderland finally got the break with four minutes left. Larsson's free-kick headed on to Ba by O'Shea, leaving Krul wrong-footed and ensuring the points were shared.  Sunderland manager Martin O'Neill:  "We were knocked back by the early goal which gives them a massive lift. They were very strong in the initial part of the game and then they had the man sent off. "Numerically, we should be able to use that better but I thought at that stage we became a bit anxious. In the second half it was just the sheer pressure that led to the equalising goal. Newcastle played excellently with the 10 men. "I must admit, slog or not, the noise that erupted from the stadium when we equalised was something that I will not forget."

24.04.2013 23:34:13 Arsenal were left 10 points behind Premier League leaders Chelsea after being stunned by Norwich, who won their first top-flight game of the season. Grant Holt put the home side ahead when he slotted in after keeper Vito Mannone had parried Alexander Tettey's shot. Michael Turner headed wide for the Canaries as the subdued Gunners struggled to create chances. Mikel Arteta had a late shot saved by John Ruddy but Norwich held firm to secure the victory. Arsenal had seen Chelsea, Manchester City and Manchester United win before their game at Carrow Road but could not match the results of their rivals as they dropped further off the Premier League pace. Manager Arsene Wenger's desperation to shake his side out of their stupor even stretched to giving attacking midfielder Serge Gnabry, 17, his league debut, although the move proved in vain as his side suffered their first away defeat this season. Wenger left Jack Wilshere on the bench on his return from 14 months out with ankle and knee injuries, and his side were crying out for the midfielder's guile to break down their stubborn opponents. Norwich winger Anthony Pilkington and Gunners striker Lukas Podolski had both gone close with early long range shots before Holt, who Wenger had highlighted as having caused his side problems last season, opened the scoring. Canaries midfielder Tettey's 25-yard shot was only parried by Mannone and Holt was quickest to react as he beat defender Per Mertesacker to the ball to poke in his third goal in as many games. The home side had conceded nine goals in their last two matches but manager Chris Hughton clearly addressed his side's defensive deficiencies during the international break. Norwich were more disciplined in their shape and determined in the tackle as they kept Arsenal at arm's length in a manner that was comfortable for them and worrying for Wenger. Arsenal lacked urgency and ideas, with Norwich's tactic of nullifying Santi Cazorla limiting the Gunners' threat. Turner might feel he should have extended the home side's lead when he met Pilkington's corner only to head wide from six yards. Arsenal's struggles were epitomised when Norwich keeper Ruddy pushed out a corner which fell to Olivier Giroud, who mistimed his hooked shot. In contrast, the home side's confidence was growing as they built on their organisation by producing some promising passing play and threatening on the counter-attack. Wenger threw on winger Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain in the hope of energising his side but he lasted just nine minutes before going off injured following a challenge by Sebastian Bassong. Holt had a chance to put the hosts out of reach when he raced clear after capitalising on a slip by Thomas Vermaelen but the striker's ambitious chip fell straight into the grateful arms of Mannone. Apart from Arteta's late strike and Gervinho seeing a chance disappear following a lunging Bassong tackle, Arsenal lacked any real threat as they suffered a first league defeat at Carrow Road since December 1984.  Norwich manager Chris Hughton:  "This has been a long time coming, which our performances have warranted. However, this league is unforgiving. "I am delighted for the team, because the work-rate was outstanding and there is no coincidence in the result. "We could have caught them on the counter more and made life easier for ourselves towards the end, but overall we restricted them and so it was a very satisfactory performance. "We have deserved this by our play this season so far, so it is a very good feeling to get the win here at Carrow Road for the supporters."

24.04.2013 23:34:13 Fulham returned to winning ways as Chris Baird's late strike ensured Aston Villa's miserable start to the Premier League season continued. Baird's finish, from John Arne Riise's corner, means Fulham have now taken 32 out of 42 points at Craven Cottage. Villa, who have mustered only six goals in eight games, remain two points above the relegation zone following their worst top-flight start since 1986. Substitute Christian Benteke missed toothless Villa's best opportunity. Scoring goals has been problematic for Villa this season and their lack of cutting edge was painfully obvious yet again. Villa boss Paul Lambert, who has laughed off talk of a rift with striker Darren Bent, restored the England international to his starting XI in a bid to rectify the problem. But Bent was starved of service as the visitors, for all their neat and tidy build-up play, lacked penetration in the final third. And they were made to pay the price as their resistance was finally ended six minutes from time by a rare goal from Baird. The Northern Irish international, fresh from his country's impressive midweek draw in Portugal, marked his 150th Fulham appearance in style to lift his team into eighth place. However, Villa nearly snatched an equaliser within seconds as Benteke, who netted for Belgium in their midweek World Cup qualifying win against Scotland, smashed a snapshot wide from Charles N'Zogbia's cross. In contrast to Villa's lack of goalscoring threat Fulham looked dangerous from the off, with Dimitar Berbatov again inspiring the Cottagers following his summer move from Manchester United. The hosts were quickly into their stride in a high-tempo start and it was Berbatov pulling all the strings. Villa goalkeeper Brad Guzan had to be alert in the opening stages to parry the Bulgarian's fierce shot from a tight angle, before denying Kieran Richardson from close range with his legs after intricate build-up play involving Berbatov and Sascha Riether. Guzan continued to be the busiest of the two goalkeepers as Villa failed to stretch Fulham stopper Mark Schwarzer. But Fulham began to lose their fluency after the half-time break, allowing the visitors to grow in confidence as they gained a foothold in the match. Agbonlahor could not flick Stephen Ireland's cross goalwards before heading over another right-wing centre from Bent at the far post. Lambert would have been happier with a point than Fulham counterpart Martin Jol, but the visiting boss was left ruing his luck after Baird scored only the third goal of his Cottagers career. And it means Villa are now winless in their last 12 Premier League away matches, spanning nine months, since beating Black Country rivals Wolves in January.  Fulham boss Martin Jol:  "It was a bit of a relief. At the end to score from a corner kick sums it up - scrappy. But we grinded out a result, which is good for us. "At home I would like to see us dominate and get the goal - that's not what we did today. But I'm happy to get the three points. "Chris Baird is very good at attacking the near post, he is always close but he hasn't scored for as long as I have known him. "I was happy to see him score - especially because the corner kick probably was not the best."  Aston Villa manager Paul Lambert:  "I thought some of the football we played was great. I thought we gave as good as we got. "We came here, where their form has been really good, and gave a good account of ourselves. "There are a lot of good things. We have to turn the good things into wins. But to concede from a set-piece was disappointing."

24.04.2013 23:34:13 Raheem Sterling scored his first Liverpool goal to hand Brendan Rodgers a long-awaited opening league victory at Anfield. Sterling, 17, delivered a virtuoso display as Liverpool recorded only their third home league win of 2012 to move into 11th place in the Premier League table. In scoring the game's decisive goal, Sterling became the second youngest Liverpool player to find the net in the Premier League, behind former England striker Michael Owen. He left the field to a standing ovation with five minutes remaining. But Rodgers' side should have won far more comfortably, spurning a host of chances during a game they totally dominated. There was a clear feeling of unease among the home support as the game wore on, with Liverpool fans scarred by previous failures to convert possession into points. On this occasion they stood firm, but a worrying lack of ruthlessness in front of goal could have cost them against more experienced sides. The week had begun with Liverpool announcing their intention to extend a 120-year love affair with Anfield - but a quick glance at their home record in 2012 was clear evidence that the famous old ground is not the bastion of invincibility it once was. Coming into this game Arsenal had won as many Premier League matches at Anfield this calendar year as the Reds and Rodgers, appointed at the end of May, was still searching for that elusive first home victory of his reign. Sterling delivered a commanding performance. His attacking play was rapier sharp, his finishing ruthless and his interplay with Luis Suarez and willingness to take up more central positions gave Liverpool a cutting edge they too often lacked. The winger's combinations with Glen Johnson down the left flank led to a series of chances for the England full-back, none of which he could convert, and Sterling also surged beyond defenders to carve out chances for Nuri Sahin and Suarez before snatching his goal. A header ran to Suarez near the halfway line and the Uruguayan striker's neat flick sent Sterling scampering clear. Two touches later the ball was in the back of the net as the England Under-21 international fired a fierce shot across goalkeeper Alex McCarthy. Liverpool's dominance continued into the second half but the longer the score remained at 1-0 the more Reading grew in confidence and Brad Jones - deputising for Pepe Reina as the Spaniard missed his first league game through injury for more than six years - twice denied the visitors as nerves built at Anfield. First Garath McCleary broke clear and tested the Liverpool reserve goalkeeper with a low shot, before Jobi McAnuff saw his curling shot turned away. However, the home side continued to dictate and Suarez, battered and bruised from a first half in which referee Rodger East did little to protect him from a number of robust Reading challenges, saw a low shot scrambled to safety by keeper Alex McCarthy before turning Sterling's crossed high over the bar. Chances came and went for substitute Jonjo Shelvey, Martin Skrtel and Johnson, while Steven Gerrard also went close. Reading threw on Jason Roberts in an attempt to snatch a point and Liverpool survived a series of nervy moments as Adam Le Fondre went close and Roberts fought for every ball. Such was the tension, the final whistle was greeted with an overwhelming sense of relief in the home dugout and among the home support.

24.04.2013 23:34:13 Wayne Rooney recovered from scoring an own goal to strike twice and earn Manchester United victory over Stoke. In a seesaw game that was in keeping with United's performances this season, Rooney nodded into his own net to give Stoke the lead and then equalised from another header before the break. Once Robin van Persie and Danny Welbeck were on target to give United the advantage, it looked like it would be a comfortable victory for the hosts. But there were again question marks about their defence as Michael Kightly ran at Rio Ferdinand to make it 3-2 before Rooney restored a two-goal cushion with a simple finish for his 200th club goal. The goals were Rooney's first for his club this season, and came after he scored three times for England on international duty with Welbeck also getting his first club goal this term. And the attacking trio of Rooney, Welbeck and Van Persie once again papered over the cracks as United chalked up their ninth win in 10 games and remain four points behind league leaders Chelsea. But ahead of the clash between the top two at Stamford Bridge next Sunday, the west Londoners will have watched with interest as Stoke caused problems in the first half during an entertaining game. The occasion was already noteworthy before kick-off when Ferdinand decided not to wear a Kick It Out T-shirt, contrary to Sir Alex Ferguson's hopes on Friday when he stated that football should remain united in its battle to fight racism in the game.  United appeared to be in control early on with Paul Scholes, making his 400th Premier League start, seeing plenty of the ball on his return to the side. But it was the midfielder's foul on Kightly which led to the opener. Ryan Shawcross was lurking but Rooney unwittingly converted Charlie Adam's cross with David De Gea nowhere to be seen. Adam then almost doubled the lead when he fired in a near-post effort, but De Gea clawed his shot away and for a period Stoke were on top with Walters also going close after a flowing move. Much of that was down to Adam, who was quick to link up with Peter Crouch and put plenty of pressure on Scholes. It was a familiar picture for the quiet home supporters, at that stage, who have seen their team go behind in seven of 11 games this season. Ferguson has already admitted this term that the attack is the strongest part of his team, and once they started to find their rhythm and movement, the Potters struggled to contain them. Welbeck had already shot wide before Rooney got the equaliser, and the England forward's first official Premier League goal of the season was created by a superb fizzing cross from Van Persie. That led to a sustained spell of pressure with the Dutch striker at its heart, and following decent opportunities for Rooney, Welbeck and Scholes, Van Persie steered in Antonio Valencia's driven cross to give United a half-time lead. It was no more than the hosts deserved and Stoke were caught napping after the break when they allowed Rooney acres of space to pick out Welbeck. Jonny Evans, who largely kept Crouch at bay, almost made it 4-1 a minute later, but Asmir Begovic stopped the Northern Irishman's close-range header and it looked at that point as if the hosts would cruise to a comfortable victory. But that is not how it has worked with United recently, and as Ferdinand backed off, Kightly ran at the hosts' defence to squeeze a shot in. Fortunately for Ferguson's side, Stoke again switched off and Rooney restored the two goal advantage by tucking in at the back post following a corner just past the hour mark. It was a relief for the Old Trafford crowd, but Ferguson's side will have to tighten up in defence ahead of next Sunday's clash with Chelsea, who will give them a far greater test.

24.04.2013 23:34:13 Spanish duo Pablo Hernandez and Miguel Michu helped steer Swansea to a first win in six league games as Wigan's poor form continued at the Liberty Stadium. Hernandez set the Swans on their way with a delightful shot on the turn following good work by Wayne Routledge. Michu doubled the lead after heading home unmarked, his sixth league goal since signing in the summer. Emmerson Boyce's flicked finish gave Wigan hope before Arouna Kone was denied an equaliser by an offside flag. Ivory Coast striker Kone will feel aggrieved that his header was not given, with television replays showing Wigan had cause for complaint. But the Latics are without a top-flight win since 25 August and will wonder how they failed to come away from Wales with at least a point after looking comfortable for long spells. It might have been different had Swans keeper Michel Vorm, celebrating his 29th birthday, not made a flying save to deny Wigan keeper Ali Al Habsi from a corner in the fifth minute of stoppage time. The thrilling climax was in stark contrast to the opening 45 minutes which proved a dull affair. With matches away to reigning champions Manchester City and home to leaders Chelsea on the horizon, it was vital Swansea ended a run of five league matches without a win. The build-up to the game was overshadowed by reports of unrest in the home dressing room, a claim Swans boss Michael Laudrup had been at pains to deny.  Yet despite failing to seriously trouble Latics keeper Al Habsi in the first half, the hosts could not be accused of a lack of effort, especially after a mistake by Boyce allowed Michu to go close with an 18th minute volley. Jonathan de Guzman, on loan from Villarreal, tried his best to inject some much needed quality into a game littered by mis-placed passes and he went close with a curling 20-yard effort. But the hosts had Vorm to thank for keeping them on level terms, the Dutch keeper denying Shaun Maloney from close range before Jean Beausejour went close to netting a rare goal from an acute angle after leaving Ki Sung-yueng trailing in his wake. The second half was much more entertaining, Hernandez's 65th minute opener the first of three goals in four minutes. Routledge did all the hard work and after getting the better of Ivan Ramis, the Swansea player delivered a fine cross which allowed Hernandez to score with a low effort. Michu doubled the lead two minutes later from a corner, Wigan's defence again at fault for allowing the Spaniard to nod home unmarked from close range. Boyce set up a grandstand finish with a clever flick in the 69th minute after clever work by Kone but despite Kone's disallowed effort and Al Habsi's last-gasp effort, Wigan could not find an equaliser on Roberto Martinez's return to his former club.  Swansea manager Michael Laudrup:  "They had a goal disallowed which was very, very tight but to come back after some games without winning it would be too easy to win without suffering. "You can say there is a mixture of joy and relief, we knew today was very important for us and I think if you see the game the players played with a lot of confidence and patience. "But you know when you really want something, in this case a win, you cannot think you can do it in 10 minutes. At this level it takes 90 or 94 minutes and that is what happened."  Wigan manager Roberto Martinez:  "I think we deserved something, it was the game we all expected in terms of the manner of both teams and the concepts we share. "It's a difficult decision and when I saw it live (offside goal) I thought it should have been given. It's disappointing that call did not go our way. "Anyway, I shouldn't talk about referees this season. I've learnt my lesson."

24.04.2013 23:34:14 Substitute Edin Dzeko scored two late goals to earn 10-man Manchester City an unlikely win against West Brom. The Premier League champions were facing an uphill struggle after James Milner's early red card for bringing down Shane Long when through on goal. And City were staring at the prospect of a first league defeat of the season when Long gave the hosts the lead. But Dzeko levelled with a header from a free-kick before finishing a blistering counter-attack in stoppage time. If there was any question of City's championship credentials following three draws in their first seven matches of the season, they were convincingly crushed in the space of 10 second-half minutes at The Hawthorns. While defeat was harsh on the Baggies, who almost snatched victory themselves when Joe Hart tipped over Romelu Lukaku's overhead kick just seconds before Dzeko's winner, this result had the mark of champions. Roberto Mancini's men are quickly becoming the Premier League's comeback kings, and the man responsible is 26-year-old Bosnian striker Dzeko. Signed for Â£27m from Wolfsburg in January 2011, Dzeko started City's incredible rally on the final day of last season when he scored in stoppage time to draw City level with Queens Park Rangers, shortly before Sergio Aguero's last-gasp winner clinched a dramatic title for the Blues. He has continued in a similar vein this season, scoring late goals as City earned victories over Southampton and Fulham.  However, before his latest intervention, City looked destined for defeat on what appeared to becoming a frustrating afternoon in the Midlands. In fact they were lucky not to be reduced to nine men in a stormy first half in which Milner was sent off and Mario Balotelli cautioned. England international Milner had no complaints about his dismissal for bringing down Long following a mistake in midfield by Vincent Kompany and a glorious throughball by James Morrison. And Italian striker Balotelli was pushing his luck as, after being booked for a petulant foul on Claudio Yacob, he clattered into another Baggies player and was pulled away from the referee by team-mates as he uttered some choice words in the direction of referee Mark Clattenburg. When Balotelli did calm himself down, he almost broke the deadlock with a moment of magic which took out two defenders on the left before his shot was well saved by Ben Foster. Carlos Tevez also went close in the first half as City looked to defy the loss of Milner. The visitors continued to go close after the break, with Tevez having a shot tipped wide before Yaya Toure headed over from six yards out. However, the spirited Baggies continued to impress when in possession and they took the lead when Peter Odemwingie's inch-perfect pass split the City defence and Long turned Joleon Lescott before calmly slotting past Hart. It was the reward for some composed football, as the Baggies constantly probed with searching balls through the middle which eventually opened up the Blues. City needed a reaction, as Baggies fans started to dream of their fifth home victory of the season, and they got it when Dzeko climbed highest to head past Foster in the 80th minute. West Brom, however, showed resolve of their own and Lukaku had two good chances to seal victory for his side when he headed straight at Hart from six yards out before seeing his acrobatic shot tipped over by the England goalkeeper. That proved to be decisive as City hit the Baggies on the counter, with Aguero squaring for Dzeko to stroke the ball home from the edge of the area and complete the comeback.  West Brom head coach Steve Clarke:  "I thought we deserved something out of the game. I thought we played well, stood up to Manchester City, but they showed when they went to 10 men that they are champions for a reason. "Credit to them, their performance with 10 men was excellent and the only feeling I have now is being disappointed to lose the game so late. "It was maybe a bad decision to go chasing the winner rather than settling for a point.  Manchester City assistant manager David Platt:  "If you look at Edin's career for Manchester City, the goals he has scored, he has got a lot of heavy goals, goals that are very important. "I remember goals at Blackburn the season before last which more or less gave us Champions League qualification. "You look back at last season as well and he got some vital goals. To win the league, Aguero's goal will always be the one but remember Edin equalised. "He has been a threat all season and his form has been very good all season."

24.04.2013 23:34:14 West Ham earned their fourth victory of the season after a Mark Noble brace and goals for Kevin Nolan and Modibo Maiga sealed all three points. Southampton pulled one back through Adam Lallana but West Ham's powerful second-half display proved too much for Nigel Adkins' side. Noble opened the scoring with a fortuitous free kick while Nolan later tapped home at the back post before Lallana made it 2-1 with a delightful turn and shot. But Noble sealed victory from the penalty spot before Maiga scored a wonderful solo goal to compound Southampton's misery. Victory consolidated West Ham's position in the top half of the table while Saints slip into the bottom three, after Norwich's win against Arsenal in Saturday's late kick off.  The game was evenly poised at the break but Southampton's early season demons continue to haunt them with yet more poor defending denying them any chance of getting something from this game. Adkins cut a forlorn figure in the post match press conference, bemoaning his side's defending, and he will know that something will need to change at the back or his side will quickly turn into relegation fodder. They have now conceded 24 goals this season - a return that is quite simply not good enough. The corresponding fixture last season saw Saints earn a valuable draw that eventually helped them gain automatic promotion from the Championship at the expense of West Ham. The Hammers had to rely on the lottery of the play-offs to go up but despite missing out to Saints and Reading on those automatic places, it is Sam Allardyce's experienced West Ham side who have made the better start to the new Premier League campaign. With 14 points already, the Hammers have a healthy return from their opening eight games while Saturday's game was further evidence that Southampton are yet to settle into Premier League life. Saints took the decision to drop star striker Rickie Lambert prior to the game but the visiting side made a bright start without creating a clear opening. The first real chance fell West Ham's way with Jos Hooiveld heading James Tomkins' looping header from 12 yards off the line. James Collins later went close with a header but by and large this was a poor first half played in a turgid atmosphere with the moans and groans of the Upton Park faithful growing louder as the half wore on. Allardyce also cut a frustrated figure on the sidelines chewing gum with more urgency and intensity than his lack-lustre side, while for Adkins it was a case of job done as the teams went into the half-time break level. But it took just 58 seconds for the Hammers to buck up their ideas and typically it came from poor Southampton defending with no-one dealing with Noble's inswinging 35-yard free kick that eventually bounced in at the back post. It was the 21st goal Saints had conceded this season, a symptom of their early-season troubles and just a minute later there was worse to come for Adkins' side. Yossi Benayoun showed more desire to get to the ball than Maya Yoshida and his cross to the back post was tapped into the empty net by Nolan. With Upton Park lifted and the supporters buoyed, Southampton's confidence evaporated as the away fans called for their talisman to be introduced - Lambert. But it was the man that was playing up front in his place - Jay Rodriguez - who helped get Saints back in the game, showing quick feet to turn inside Collins before releasing Lallana. With his back to goal the midfielder swivelled delightfully before powering a shot into the roof of the net. Lambert was then introduced and he went desperately close with a free kick from 20 yards. But the Hammers soon restored their two-goal advantage with another Noble free kick causing Saints problems and Jose Fonte was penalised for handball after coming under pressure from Andy Carroll. Noble powered in the spot kick to a collective sigh of relief and Carroll continued to cause Hooiveld problems at the back before he was replaced to a standing ovation. The on-loan Liverpool striker is quickly on his way to becoming a cult hero at Upton Park. West Ham pressed for a fourth and it came late on through Maiga who sealed the rout with a wonderful solo goal that embarrassed three Southampton defenders.

24.04.2013 23:34:14 Chelsea made it a day of misery for former manager Andre Villas-Boas as they stayed top of the Premier League with victory in an enthralling encounter at White Hart Lane. Tottenham boss Villas-Boas was facing Chelsea for the first time since he was sacked in March after only nine months in charge - and for a brief spell in the second half it looked like he would celebrate with three points. Chelsea, without captain John Terry as he started a four-match ban for racially abusing QPR's Anton Ferdinand, led at half-time through Gary Cahill's magnificent volley. Spurs, however, reversed fortunes dramatically at the start of the second half with two quick goals from William Gallas and Jermain Defoe. It was a situation that called for Chelsea to show the substance to match the style this reshaped side is offering up this season. They delivered both to secure a hugely impressive win. The outstanding Juan Mata struck twice in three minutes as Chelsea regained the ascendancy and substitute Daniel Sturridge's simple fourth in stoppage time completed a hugely satisfying performance from the Champions League holders. Spurs were forced into a late change when Gareth Bale dropped out of their starting line-up after his partner went into labour - and it was understandable that they should miss a player of his influence. Nothing, however, can diminish the growing sense that even though this Chelsea team is undergoing something of a transition, they have the quality to be very serious contenders for the title this season. And, in Mata, they have a player of the highest quality as a creator and scorer who was able to cast his spell over this wonderful game. Gallas, who endured a miserable day defensively, wasted a perfect opportunity to give Spurs the lead after only three minutes when he failed to make firm contact with Gylfi Sigurdsson's free-kick from six yards. Chelsea's approach and change in personnel allows them a great deal of fluidity. Young Brazilian Oscar is central to this change in emphasis and he showed his threat with a long-range effort that flew just wide. Villas-Boas demonstrated his faith in 41-year-old Brad Friedel by reinstating him ahead of France goalkeeper Hugo Lloris but the veteran was powerless to stop Cahill putting Chelsea ahead after 17 minutes. Gallas's headed clearance from Eden Hazard's corner was met by Cahill, who showed perfect technique to send a thunderous volley high past Friedel. Spurs produced a spirited response, with Cech scrambling to save from Defoe, but Chelsea remained dangerous and Mata should have done better than shoot off target after his first effort had been blocked by Friedel. Villas-Boas clearly demanded greater urgency from his players during the break - and he received it as they struck twice in the opening stages of the second period to turn the game around. Gallas scored his first goal for Spurs when he glanced in after Jan Vertonghen hooked back from the far post then Defoe added the second after 54 minutes, turning in Aaron Lennon's driven cross for his 200th career goal. It was time for Chelsea to demonstrate their own resilience and they did not disappoint, producing two quick goals from Mata to regain the advantage Spurs had taken from them. Another poor clearance from Gallas offered Mata the opportunity to shoot low past Friedel from the edge of the area, then the Spaniard accepted Eden Hazard's pass to send a composed finish past Friedel. Villas-Boas introduced Emmanuel Adebayor for the subdued Clint Dempsey in an attempt to regain the initiative - but it was fitting that Mata should have a say in the final act as he rolled a perfect cross in for Sturridge to score with ease.

24.04.2013 23:34:14 Manchester United secured their fifth win in seven Premier League games as victory at Newcastle sent them second. Starting the day seven points adrift of leaders Chelsea, it was vital for the visitors to pick up three points, and two headers from corners in the first 15 minutes set them on their way. Jonny Evans was first to make the net bulge before fellow defender Patrice Evra repeated the trick moments later. Tom Cleverley made it 3-0 when he curled the ball into the top corner. The midfielder might have been trying to find Robin van Persie at the far post, but the ball flew out of the reach of home keeper Steve Harper and into the goal. While the goal may have had a touch of good fortune, there was nothing lucky about the Old Trafford club's overall display. Sir Alex Ferguson's men were rampant in the opening quarter, helped by some amateur Newcastle defending at set-pieces, and twice went close before the first goal. Danny Welbeck, who played furthest forward in a three-man attack featuring Wayne Rooney and Van Persie, was first to try his luck but struck a woefully tame shot from six yards. Harper then had to guard his near post to stop Van Persie's toe-poke from sneaking in, but he had no chance when Evans powered home a header after eight minutes for only his second goal for the Red Devils. Newcastle had the jitters and could have fallen further behind but, after creating another chance for himself when he closed down the dawdling Harper just inside the area, Welbeck failed to find the empty net. However, the visitors made the pressure count again a couple of minutes later when Evra advanced from the edge of the area to head in his first goal for the club in two seasons. The highest scoring match between the teams at the ground was in January 1960, when the hosts won 7-3, and with only 15 minutes on the clock another 10-goal feast - all scored by the visiting team - did not seem totally impossible. But the attacking waves from the visitors died down, allowing Newcastle to come back into the match. Magpies boss Alan Pardew tinkered with their tactics and had a quick word with his backline as Evans received treatment for an injury, and that seemed to help mend the leak in defence. But the home side were also lacking inspiration in attack and once again the Demba Ba-Papiss Cisse partnership failed to shine, although they did suffer from poor service. The pair were central to Newcastle's best effort, though. Ba flicked a header towards goal and when the ball came off the post it was nodded towards the net by Cisse, but the agile David De Gea just managed to claw it away before it had crossed the line. Hatem Ben Arfa and Yohan Cabaye also had efforts on goal, but they were as half-hearted as the Magpies' display. Cleverley rounded off a miserable day for Newcastle with his spectacular effort.

24.04.2013 23:34:14 Liverpool and West Ham fought out a largely disappointing goalless draw which damages the home team's European ambitions but eased relegation concerns for their opponents. The Hammers were denied their first win at Anfield for 50 years when Lucas Leiva cleared Jack Collison's late header off the line. Luis Suarez was marshalled expertly by West Ham defender James Collins, although the Uruguay forward did force an injury-time save from Jussi Jaaskelainen at the goalkeeper's near post with a low shot. The draw leaves Liverpool in seventh, three points behind local rivals Everton having played an extra match, while West Ham are now seven points clear of the relegation zone. It also brings the east London side to within a point of the 38-point target manager Sam Allardyce has set before he signs a new contract with the Upton Park club. The central-defensive pairing of Collins and James Tomkins were crucial to securing their side's clean sheet, as Allardyce earned a first point in his last nine games against the Reds. The match had been preceded by a minute's silence in the last game at Anfield before the 24th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster on 15 April. When the action got under way, Liverpool had the majority of possession and looked the more threatening going forward, without creating any clear-cut chances. And it was the visitors who went close to taking the lead when midfielder Mohamed Diame, showing sparks of his quality, beat four Liverpool defenders inside the box before hammering a strike over the bar. Liverpool's frustrations increased when Daniel Sturridge, who replaced Stewart Downing midway through the first half, saw his shot on the turn saved at the far post on the stroke of half-time. After the break, the Merseysiders increased the pressure but the visitors held firm, Tomkins blocking a goal-bound Steven Gerrard effort just in front of the line. The home side did have the ball in the net when Sturridge turned in Jordan Henderson's shot only for the goal to be disallowed for offside. West Ham thought they should have had a penalty for a Jose Enrique tackle on Tomkins, who then might have conceded a spot-kick himself for a challenge on Gerrard. As Liverpool continued to struggle to find a way through the visitors, West Ham almost stole the three points late on but Lucas cleared Collison's header off the goal-line.  Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers:  "The effort the players put in was very good. We just needed a bit of luck to go our way. I'm disappointed Daniel Sturridge's goal was disallowed for offside as I thought it was onside. "You have to give West Ham credit as they defended very well. I never for one moment thought they were going to win it. They got in some great blocks and are an honest group of players that put their bodies on the line but only one team tried to win it and that was us, but we couldn't put the ball in the back of the net."  West Ham manager Sam Allardyce:  "I am content, even though we should have won the game. We nullified Liverpool's strengths and created the better chances to score. I'm delighted. It's only our finishing that has cost us the three points. "Jose Enrique kicked James Tomkins when we should have had a penalty but I am satisfied with the performance and result. We know we've created better chances than Liverpool, even though they had more possession. "James Collins and James Tomkins were outstanding. It's a big point. We are ever closer to the magic 40."

24.04.2013 23:34:14 Liverpool remain without a home league win this season as they were held to a draw in a fractious game against Stoke. Stoke's best chances came after the Reds gave the ball away with a Charlie Adam shot being saved and a Michael Kightly effort being tipped over. The home side went close when Steven Gerrard had a strike palmed away, while Daniel Agger glanced a shot just wide. Reds winger Raheem Sterling struck an effort against the woodwork as a resolute Stoke held on for a point. Liverpool centre-back Martin Skrtel also went close late on when he poked a shot at goal from an acute angle only to see the strike hit the face of the post, with Luis Suarez just out of reach to turn the ball home. Suarez was his side's main threat in the game and, although he has claimed to have legitimate penalty appeals turned down this season, he did not help his cause when he appeared to go to ground too easily after wriggling past Marc Wilson. However, the Uruguayan was on the end of some harsh treatment by a Stoke side who picked up six bookings. Suarez and centre-back Robert Huth were involved in regular tussles, which started when Huth appeared to stamp on the former early on in the game. Ultimately, Liverpool's passing game was not refined or piercing enough to break through a disciplined and determined Potters side, who earned a draw but have gone 13 top-flight away games without a win. The Reds, meanwhile, have won just four of their last 19 home league games and their problems at Anfield continued. The home side struggled to find the rhythm and range of their passing game under the pressure and physical nature of Stoke's play as both sides wrestled for some sort of superiority early on. Stoke's closing down forced the home side into two mistakes, although the visitors could not punish their hosts. Nuri Sahin gave the ball away to midfielder Adam, who left Anfield to join Stoke in the summer, and his shot from just inside the area was saved by keeper Pepe Reina. Reina was also culpable shortly afterwards as he tried to play the ball out of defence only to hand possession to Stoke. Kightly almost capitalised when he tried to chip in but the backtracking Reina tipped over his bar to save his blushes. Gerrard had a long range shot pushed wide by keeper Asmir Begovic, while Agger's glancing strike from a dinked Suso cross clipped the outside of the post. Liverpool picked up the pace and showed more urgency after the break. Begovic smothered and gathered a well-struck 22-yard strike by left-back Glen Johnson, who also latched on to a raking Gerrard pass before shooting high. Agger pulled off a vital interception as Kightly tried to set up Adam for a simple finish but most of the pressure was being applied by the home side. Suarez surged toward the Stoke goal and sidestepped the visitors' defence only to shoot the wrong side of the post before Sterling met an Agger cross with a shot which hit the outside of the upright. Some theatrics from Suarez did not fool referee Lee Mason and, after Skrtel went close, he blew the whistle on a frustrating afternoon for Liverpool.

24.04.2013 23:34:14 Tottenham earned their fourth straight Premier League victory as second-half goals from Steven Caulker and Aaron Lennon saw off Aston Villa. After a subdued first half where Gareth Bale and Jermain Defoe went close, Villa's Christian Benteke headed wide before Caulker gave Spurs the lead. It was fortunate, as Defoe controlled Bale's corner at the back post before his shot deflected in off Caulker. But Lennon's strike nine minutes later sealed the win with a touch of class. It was the winger's first goal for nine months, adding to Caulker's first for the club, and Spurs could have made it 3-0 when Bale hit the post late on. Their task was made much easier when Villa were reduced to 10 men, having used all their substitutes, following a serious-looking injury to left-back Joe Bennett with 13 minutes left. The former Middlesbrough player was taken off on a stretcher after he and Bale chased the ball to the goal-line and crashed into the advertising hoardings. Villa are still to win away from home this season, while Andre-Villas Boas' team remain unbeaten at White Hart Lane and move to fifth in the table. Other than the two goals in a nine-minute period, the game was no classic but it made for a comfortable Premier League debut for Tottenham keeper Hugo Lloris, who ended Brad Friedel's incredible record of 310 consecutive Premier League games. Lloris was rarely tested, although a poor throw did contribute to Villa's best chance, but questions will remain about Villa boss Paul Lambert's use of striker Darren Bent. The England forward started the game on the bench, having scored last week against West Brom, and he would have watched in horror as Benteke headed off-target just before Spurs went ahead. Villa struggled to cope with Tottenham's initial threat down the left, with right-winger Lennon seeing more of the ball as the half wore on, but Villas-Boas's side failed to test Brad Guzan significantly. At one stage the American keeper darted out of the box to intercept a Spurs through ball, but did well to avoid clipping the advancing Bale, who was lucky not to be booked as he went to ground. The visitors rode the Spurs swell of pressure and came more into the game as Gabriel Agbonlahor cut in from the left to receive the ball with Lloris quick to close the Villa forward down when he was put through, and the France international keeper also punched Benteke's effort away. Benteke then twice went close after the break, first shooting straight at Lloris and then heading wide from Marc Albrighton's cross when Spurs' France international keeper had given the ball away. Those near misses seemed to spark Tottenham, however, and after Defoe had shot narrowly wide following a quick break Spurs took the lead. From a deep corner from the right, Defoe controlled the ball at the back post and fired towards goal but with the ball heading wide it clipped off Caulker's heel for his first Premier League goal. Bent was eventually introduced, alongside Charles N'Zogbia, but they barely had time to break sweat before Tottenham went further ahead when Lennon ran straight at Bennett and smashed a shot into the far corner. Once Villa's full-back went off there was little chance for them to alter the course of the game, and Spurs are now beginning to build real momentum.  Aston Villa manager Paul Lambert: "We were well in the game, and had two brilliant chances through Christian Benteke. He has to score one of the two of them, especially away from home; he has to hit the target from the header. "I've said that to him you have to score those at this level but he's a young player and he will learn every day."

24.04.2013 23:34:14 Southampton moved out of the bottom three as Jose Fonte's last-minute goal rescued a point against Fulham. The Portuguese defender had given the hosts an early lead when he headed in after four minutes. Jos Hooiveld, on as a substitute for the injured Frazer Richardson, diverted John Arne Riise's shot into his own net to draw Fulham level. Kieran Richardson looked to have won it with a deflected shot two minutes from time, but Fonte nodded in an equaliser. Nigel Adkins' side went into the game looking to record a second successive home victory in the Premier League and they made the ideal start, captain Adam Lallana swung a corner into the area and Fonte rose to loop a header beyond the reach of Mark Schwarzer. Southampton were forced into a change minutes later as Richardson left the field through injury and he was replaced by Hooiveld, who went into the centre of defence with Maya Yoshida moving to right-back. The reshuffle allowed Fulham to enjoy a spell of possession and they forced a couple of corners, but it was Southampton who went closest to scoring again when Lallana fed a pass to Jay Rodriguez on the left of the area and the former Burnley man crossed low for Rickie Lambert, but the striker shot wide of goal. Jason Puncheon was next to go close for Southampton as a corner was headed on by Lambert and the winger stabbed a shot towards goal, but Sascha Riether cleared off the line. The two combined again soon after as this time Lambert shot straight at Schwarzer after he was picked out by Puncheon's chipped pass. Fulham finished the half strongly and had a couple of chances to draw level before the break as first Aaron Hughes directed a header at Southampton keeper Paulo Gazzaniga, before Hooiveld was caught out by a long ball into the area and Hugo Rodallega almost capitalised, but could only poke a shot wide of goal. Lambert rifled a shot well over the bar after running onto Morgan Schneiderlin's pass as Southampton started the second half strongly, but they had Gazzaniga to thank for keeping the scores level on the hour mark. Seconds after Steve Sidwell had bundled a shot onto the post, Rodallega's close-range header looked destined for the back of the net but the Saints keeper somehow managed to get a hand to the ball and protect his side's slender advantage. But there was nothing Gazzaniga could do when Fulham equalised as Riise's shot from outside the area was heading wide before Hooiveld stuck out a boot to divert the ball into his own net. Southampton have made a habit of dropping points from winning positions this season and it looked as if Fulham had done enough to snatch victory as substitute Kieran Richardson's 88th-minute shot deflected off Hooiveld and past Gazzaniga. But Fonte prevented Southampton from slipping to a sixth defeat of the season when he headed in from Daniel Fox's delivery in the 90th minute.  Southampton manager Nigel Adkins: "It was a good first half from our boys, we scored a good goal from a set play and we created opportunities, but I was disappointed with how we played in the second half. "We created some opportunities and could have scored more goals but it is two poor goals we have conceded. "In the cold light of day we have taken a point and it is obviously pleasing to come back after conceding late on."  Fulham manager Martin Jol: "We didn't play our football in the first half. They pressured us and our first pass was not good enough, we couldn't get the ball to our better players, which is what they did, so all credit to them. "It is always difficult if you go to places like Southampton and concede a goal after four minutes, that is very disappointing. "Even the good teams don't usually win more than five or six away games in a season, so if you do that then usually you do well."

24.04.2013 23:34:14 Olivier Giroud scored his first Premier League goal for Arsenal as the Gunners came from behind to beat West Ham. West Ham took the lead against the run of play when Mohamed Diame beat Vito Mannone with a curling shot. Giroud equalised before the break when he poked in Lukas Podolski's cross at the near post. Kevin Nolan missed two chances for the hosts and was made to pay when Theo Walcott came off the bench to make it 2-1 with Santi Cazorla hitting a third. Walcott, who replaced the disappointing Gervinho, helped the Gunners take advantage in the last half hour as West Ham tired. But having been on top for large parts of the game, it was no more than Arsene Wenger's team deserved as they extended their unbeaten record against the Hammers to nine games and moved to fifth in the Premier League table. Sam Allardyce's side had to defend stoutly throughout the game but they came up against a midfield again run by the impressive Cazorla. And their disappointment in losing their first Premier League home game of the season was compounded by an injury to forward Ricardo Vaz Te, who went off with a suspected dislocated shoulder. Walcott and Cazorla's late goals in the space of six minutes gave the scoreline added gloss as Andy Carroll caused concern in the visitors' defence on the striker's first start since suffering a hamstring injury. But the result was the perfect response to the Gunners' defeat by Chelsea last weekend and means that is the only league defeat of their season so far. Carroll's value was also underlined when he spent much of the first 20 minutes bolstering the Hammers defence as Arsenal wasted a number of promising opportunities. Giroud almost scored in the first two minutes when Jussi Jaaskelainen tipped his shot round the post and Carroll blocked the French striker's goal-bound effort later in the first half. So when West Ham's goal came on 21 minutes it was something of a surprise. Diame was fed by George McCartney down the left and the Senegalese player skipped past Aaron Ramsey before curling a delightful finish into the far corner for his first Hammers goal. Referee Phil Dowd booked the midfielder for his celebration and perhaps Diame was fortunate to stay on the field soon after when he clattered Mikel Arteta. Then, just as Carroll began to become more influential in the attacking half, Diame had his pocket picked in midfield leading to the equaliser. The ball was swept to Podolski on the left and Giroud burst to the near post to tuck in the German's cross for a true poacher's goal. Having got themselves back on level terms, Arsenal took time to warm to a similarly attacking theme as the first period. By that stage, Carroll had almost made it 2-1 but his header from a long diagonal ball was just wide with Mannone beaten to the delivery, while Nolan wasted a great chance when clean through. As Arsenal began to assert their authority on the game, Walcott latched onto Giroud's through ball just 16 minutes after coming on to score his fourth goal of the season with a precise near-post shot. Another chance fell to Nolan, but he fired over from the edge of the penalty box, and that miss proved costly once Cazorla smashed in Arsenal's third from 20 yards to cap a superb individual performance. The only worry for Arsenal was with left-back Kieran Gibbs, who left the field in the second half with what Wenger described afterwards as a "thigh problem".

24.04.2013 23:34:14 Chelsea put their off-field troubles aside as they emphatically beat struggling Norwich to continue to set the Premier League pace. John Terry and Ashley Cole started for the home side but they went behind when Grant Holt drove in a 15-yard shot. Chelsea hit back with a Fernando Torres header and Frank Lampard drilled in an 18-yard shot to extend the Blues lead. Juan Mata set up Eden Hazard to slot in a third before Branislav Ivanovic powered in Chelsea's fourth. The playmaking trio of Mata, Hazard and Oscar buzzed around with an incisiveness and invention that Norwich could not handle with the former particularly prominent. Mata has four goals and five assists in the last five games and the stylish Spaniard was the main orchestrator as his side secured a sixth top-flight win in seven. Norwich were left still searching for a first league victory of the season and manager Chris Hughton will be concerned at the leaking of 17 goals so far this campaign. The victory for Chelsea will also be a relief for the Stamford Bridge side after the previous day's troubles. The club had first learned of the Football Association's ruling that John Terry's evidence was "improbable, implausible and contrived" in the hearing over whether the defender racially abused QPR's Anton Ferdinand.  A tweet from Blues left-back Cole criticising the FA over comments about his role in the case caused more turmoil. Both players were selected to play by boss Roberto Di Matteo but, after Torres missed an early chance, they failed to stop the visitors taking the lead. Wes Hoolahan chipped a cross to the far post where Leon Barnett nodded the ball down for Holt to drive in a shot from just inside the area for his second league goal of the season. The lead did not last long as Ivanovic crossed for Torres to head in from eight yards as the Canaries defence stood and watched. Norwich have let in five goals twice already this season and, despite playing with a five-man midfield to be more defensively stable, they could not stop Chelsea, playing with vibrancy and verve, surging into a two-goal advantage. An acrobatic Torres shot was blocked by Russell Martin but the effort was only cleared to Lampard, who thumped in a shot from the edge of the area. Soon afterwards, the exemplary Mata ran unchallenged for half of the pitch before sliding through a pass which Hazard coolly tucked past keeper John Ruddy. Norwich were playing on the counter-attack and had they had more of a cutting edge in the final third they might have caused Chelsea more concern. Holt headed just wide from a Hoolahan cross in a promising chance for the visitors. But Chelsea were in no mood to allow any sort of comeback and the manner with which they stroked the ball about with style and panache after their summer upheavals is a credit to the job Di Matteo is doing. Ivanovic completed the victory with a drilled fourth, with Chelsea now holding a four-point lead at the Premier League summit.  Chelsea manager Roberto Di Matteo:  "We're pleased that we're going into this international break at the top of the Premier League. "We have so many more games to play but we're in a good position and have a lot of confidence. "As long as we don't have many injuries, we'll keep chipping away and try to win as many games and points as we can. "I still think Manchester City - if you look at their squad - and Manchester United will be up there."  Norwich boss Chris Hughton:  "I was probably more annoyed and disappointed at half-time than I was at the end of the game because, after taking the lead, we certainly needed to be in the game for longer. "When you come here, particularly with the quality that they have got - the offensive quality they've got now - you know it's going to be a tough ask. But, when you score so early, you need to stay in the game longer. "At the moment, as a team, we're not defending well enough."

24.04.2013 23:34:14 Wayne Routledge scored a stunning equaliser as Swansea stopped a run of three defeats and denied Reading their first Premier League win of the season. A string of top-class saves from Alex McCarthy kept Swansea at bay after Pavel Pogrebnyak squeezed his shot under Michel Vorm to put Reading ahead. Noel Hunt doubled the visitors' lead with a sharp volley but Miguel Michu's diving header gave Swansea hope. The excellent Routledge then hit a pile-driver to claim a draw. The last time the two sides met was in the 2011 Championship play-off final, when Swansea crushed Reading's Premier League hopes with a thrilling 4-2 win.  Brian McDermott's side had to wait another season to join their conquerors in the top flight, but Saturday's performance will have given further encouragement despite the disappointment of watching a first win slip from their grasp. Swansea started brightly and Ashley Williams, confirmed this week as the new Wales captain, worked himself space in the Reading six-yard box at a free-kick but could only put his header wide of McCarthy's left-hand post. The home side continued to press and Reading goalkeeper McCarthy again had to be on his toes to tip Danny Graham's powerful header over the crossbar, after Routledge whipped in a left-wing cross. Routledge was again involved soon after as the winger took Michu's pin-point diagonal through ball in his stride but fired straight at McCarthy. While it was Swansea's attacking midfielders who were catching the eye, the fulcrum of their neat play was Leon Britton - playing his 400th game for the south Wales club through all four divisions and slotting into the holding role vacated by Joe Allen's departure to Liverpool. Reading were struggling to get to grips with the game and only the imposing figure of Pogrebnyak offered any relief for the hard-pressed Royals, as the striker used his strength to hold the ball up. The Russian's appetite for hard-work was rewarded as he gave Reading the lead completely against the run of play, taking Jobi McAnuff's pass down the left channel and watching his shot squirt under Vorm and into the Swansea goal. The set-back left the usually rock-solid Dutch keeper scratching his head and visibly took the wind out of the sails of a Swansea side who had not found the back of the net in their three previous Premier League games, all defeats. Reading then delivered a hammer blow a minute before half-time as Hunt doubled the visitors' lead with their second shot on target. Swansea's defence did well to close down a series of snap-shots, but the last from McAnuff spun wickedly off Angel Rangel's foot and dropped perfectly for Hunt who converted with a crisp right-foot volley across Vorm. Luke Moore replaced Graham for Swansea at the start of the second half and almost made an immediate impact as he surged through the middle, only for McCarthy to pull off a fine save with his outstretched right boot. Moments later McCarthy again came to Reading's rescue as the goalkeeper clawed Moore's header out of the air and just diverted the ball onto a post. McCarthy's superb afternoon continued as the keeper instinctively stuck out a hand to parry Ki Sung-Yeung's deflected shot, then saved low to his right to keep out Williams' header from the resulting corner. Reading's resistance was finally broken 17 minutes from time as Routledge's cross took a slight deflection and Michu flew in at the back post to send a diving header into the net. Swansea surged foward and within seven minutes Routledge got the goal his efforts deserved, exchanging passes with Moore before smashing home an unstoppable equaliser. Pablo Hernandez, on for Nathan Dyer, almost gives Swansea an improbable victory, chipping over the bar amid claims of handball against Nicky Shorey. But Reading were not finished either and Williams had to be alert to head Jem Karacan's looping header off the line after Vorm failed to get enough distance with a clearing punch.  Swansea  manager  Michael Laudrup: "I think when you're 2-0 down and come back you should be pleased and then you add we had three consecutive defeats. "It is important that we stopped the losses. That was important, you can say one point from four is quite poor but we are still five clear of the bottom [three]. "These are the games that show if your team has character and I think we showed that today."  Reading manager Brian McDermott  : "I don't look at it like that [waiting for the win to come], I just look at the performances. "The wins will come with the performances, our belief and confidence is absolutely fine. "We won the Championship last year, they know how to win games and they will do in this league."

24.04.2013 23:34:14 West Brom continued their fine start to the season as they overcame QPR to add to the pressure on Mark Hughes. Rangers boss Hughes has received owner    but the league's bottom side were behind early. James Morrison headed in after five minutes before Zoltan Gera capitalised on Anton Ferdinand's error for 2-0. Adel Taarabt's brilliant volley reduced the deficit but Youssouf Mulumbu swept in late on and Esteban Granero's fine strike was only a consolation for QPR. The Spaniard's exquisite goal was followed seconds later by a glorious chance to equalise for Jose Bosingwa, but the defender blazed over from close range. Despite their strong finish, QPR failed to learn from the chastening experience of their previous game, when they afforded West Ham far too much time and space in midfield and were duly punished.  Perhaps the selection of Granero in place of Alejandro Faurlin was an acknowledgement of that problem by Hughes, but the former Real Madrid midfielder - excellent going forward throughout - is hardly the destructive presence they are lacking. West Brom have been one of the standout teams so far this season - they have now recorded their best start to a top-flight campaign in 93 years - and they did not need the encouragement afforded them by the visitors. The Baggies' start was explosive, capitalising on QPR's defensive vulnerability and an obvious lack of confidence after five minutes as Morrison headed home Shane Long's cross to finish off a lightning counter-attack. Maybe that was only to be expected, since QPR have a dismal away record following their return to the Premier League, taking only three points from a possible 48 before this match. Indeed, Hughes has yet to win a league game on the road since taking charge at Loftus Road. And there was an air of resignation about Rangers, even before they fell 2-0 behind. Gera had already had several sights of goal and he was lurking as Anton Ferdinand made a mess of dealing with a right-wing cross. As the ball fell to the Hungarian, he steadied himself and slotted calmly beyond QPR keeper Julio Cesar from 12 yards. But for all their early struggles, Hughes will have been encouraged by his side's response. Taarabt, the architect of their promotion to the Premier League two seasons ago but a peripheral figure since then, produced a moment of magic to drag Rangers back into contention. He collected Granero's clever chipped pass 10 minutes before the break, controlled the ball on his chest and rifled a fierce volley beyond Ben Foster from just inside the penalty area. QPR's squad boasts an eclectic mix of players following Hughes's summer signing spree but there is no doubting they possess the talent to trouble Premier League opponents. And with the confidence provided by the goal, they began to look more of a force, with Taarabt at the heart of much of their best play. He and Shaun Wright-Phillips both went close after the break, as did Granero, but their finishing left much to be desired. That wastefulness was punished when the fluency that deserted West Brom during the middle of the game returned to stunning effect with five minutes left, Mulumbu capitalising on Gonzalo Jara's precise pass at the end of a sweeping team move. There was still time for Granero to curl in a sumptuous second for QPR and Bosingwa to waste arguably the day's easiest opportunity, ensuring Rangers remain bottom and West Brom move up to fourth.  West Brom manager Steve Clarke: "Defensively we weren't at our best but I'm happy. We moved the ball well and looked good going forward. Both teams went out there to win it. There were a few mistakes and some casual play in possession, but we had some good moves and the quality of the goals were top class."  QPR manager Mark Hughes:  "In the early part of the game we gave ourselves too much to do. We talk about the fundamentals of defending and we didn't do that. We didn't start correctly. We were slow and not dynamic. They produced two good balls and we didn't deal with them. "If you go 2-0 down away from home it's nigh-on impossible to get back into it. For the vast majority of the game I thought we were in control, but we need to take the defensive errors out of our game."

24.04.2013 23:34:14 A late penalty from Leighton Baines earned Everton a point after Wigan Athletic threatened to dent their outstanding start to the season. Everton started the game in second place in the Premier League but only got to grips with Wigan's intensity in the second half to get the draw their pressure ultimately deserved. Arouna Kone looked suspiciously offside as he gave Wigan an early lead but the prolific Nikica Jelavic headed Everton level within seconds. Franco Di Santo restored Wigan's advantage before the interval - and Baines ensured the points were shared with his former club from the spot three minutes from time after Maynor Figueroa brought down Kevin Mirallas. Everton manager David Moyes will settle for the point after being behind for so long and will have been satisfied with the battling qualities shown by his players. But this was not the fluent Everton that have risen so high in the table and credit must go to Wigan as they fought ferociously, taking the game to the Merseysiders in the first half before they were eventually pushed so far back that they were punished in the dying minutes. The Toffees also had a succession of penalty appeals ignored by referee Kevin Friend before finally being awarded the late spot kick from which Baines scored their second equaliser. Everton were unchanged after their fine opening to the campaign - but they carried an air of complacency until picking up the pace as half-time approached. Wigan were determined not to let Everton settle, particularly Marouane Fellaini, and the pace of Kone was utilised as he troubled John Heitinga whenever he was able to isolate the Netherlands defender. It was Kone who put Wigan ahead, turning in at close range after Shaun Maloney escaped from Everton defender Seamus Coleman. Everton instantly protested and replays suggested that the striker was offside when he converted the chance. Everton were level just 72 seconds later and the source was no surprise. Steven Pienaar's wayward shot turned into an inviting cross for the predatory Jelavic to head in at the far post. For all the expansive style Everton have shown this season, they looked horribly vulnerable at the back and Wigan regained their lead midway through the first half. Di Santo had already tested Everton keeper Tim Howard from long range and he made no mistake from 12 yards after Kone once again got away from Heitinga. Everton did show signs of life as Ali Al Habsi saved superbly from Leon Osman's deflected shot and Mirallas fired just wide after another effort from 20 yards took a touch off a Wigan defender. The half ended with Wigan fans demanding the dismissal of Fellaini - who had earlier swung a kick at Gary Caldwell in the area - after he floored Figueroa in an aerial challenge. Wigan players and manager Roberto Martinez protested that the Belgian had used his elbow but referee Friend showed the yellow card. Moyes put Heitinga out of his misery by replacing him with Sylvain Distin for the start of the second half. He also made the tactical adjustment of pushing Mirallas alongside Jelavic. And the lively young Belgium forward almost made it work twice as he shot just over then forced a fine low save from Al Habsi as Everton applied more pressure than they had previously done. Wigan were adopting a direct style to test Everton and it needed a superb saving tackle from Phil Jagielka to stop Kone adding a second before Pienaar's shot was pushed away by Al Habsi. Just as Wigan looked to have survived for a victory, Mirallas fell under a challenge from Figueroa and Baines lashed the penalty high past Al Habsi. It was a fitting reward for the outstanding Baines, who struck the post in the first half, but Maloney's deflected shot was only inches away from snatching victory in stoppage time in a rousing finale to a frenetic encounter.  Wigan manager Roberto Martinez:  "It was a very good performance. When you play against this Everton side you're really going to be tested to the full. I'm really pleased with the amount of opportunities we created, in the first half I thought we were superior. "I haven't seen [the penalty decision] again. But it seemed from where I was that there was a slight contact. I haven't seen it well enough to comment, but it looked as though it was a penalty live. "We managed to stop Everton being a real threat and the amount of chances we created against this Everton side showed how good we are."  Everton boss David Moyes:  "It was a hard-earned point - we worked really hard to get back in to the game. We didn't start well, but Wigan did. "We kept at it and deserved to get a goal back. I thought we had another penalty shout with Nikica Jelavic in the second half which should have been given. "Leighton Baines was outstanding today. At times he was unplayable he was that good."

24.04.2013 23:34:14 Manchester City returned to form with a deserved victory over Sunderland thanks to goals from Aleksandar Kolarov, Sergio Aguero and James Milner. The Premier League champions had won just one of their previous six matches in all competitions but were fine value for this victory. Kolarov's free-kick gave City an early lead and substitute Aguero made it two with a neat finish after half-time. Milner's set-piece was deflected in by Craig Gardner to seal the points. Roberto Mancini's men had numerous chances to improve the scoreline but they will be delighted with the result. It was City's first clean sheet of the season and moves them up to second in the table, four points behind leaders Chelsea. Mancini admitted the quick turnaround from Wednesday's Champions League draw with Borussia Dortmund was "a problem". But despite making seven changes to the line-up, his side had little trouble inflicting a first loss of the season on Sunderland. One of those changes saw Carlos Tevez come into the side and it was a menacing run from him that led to the opener. The Argentine surged down the left only for Carlos Cuellar to arrive with a reckless challenge. Left-back Kolarov stepped up to curl an unstoppable free-kick past Simon Mignolet at his near post - the in-form Serb's fourth goal in five games for club and country. It was the first time Sunderland had gone a goal behind this season and they briefly pressed forward in an attempt to hit back. Stephane Sessegnon volleyed over but the visitors lacked creativity and Steven Fletcher found himself isolated up front. City were dominating possession and Mignolet denied Pablo Zabaleta before Tevez screwed wide from the follow-up. The one team to come away from Etihad Stadium last season unbeaten were Sunderland - they drew 3-3 having led 3-1 after 85 minutes - and it was inevitable they would improve after half-time. Sebastian Larsson began to find more space and his floated cross was volleyed towards goal by Fletcher, only for the excellent Micah Richards to arrive with a crucial block. But as Sunderland improved, so did City, and the Black Cats' greater ambition made for a more open and expansive encounter. Toure saw a powerful drive tipped over the bar after David Silva's superb flick and Danny Rose cleared a shot off the line from Richards, who was making his first appearance of the campaign. After Balotelli failed to connect with a low cross by Kolarov, the Italian was replaced by Aguero and he made an immediate impact. Kolarov produced another inviting centre from the left and Aguero met it with a superb first-time finish past Mignolet. The chances were now flowing and Tevez drilled wide, Silva chipped on to the crossbar and City keeper Joe Hart saved James McClean's header en route to his 50th Premier League clean sheet. Milner's industry was rewarded when his free-kick skimmed off Gardner's head and past Mignolet, who foiled Aguero late on but could not prevent City going into the international break on a high.

24.04.2013 23:34:14 West Ham heaped more misery on 10-man Queens Park Rangers as they held on to win at Loftus Road and keep their hosts bottom of the Premier League. Record signing Matt Jarvis gave West Ham a dream start by heading in after three minutes and Ricardo Vaz Te poked in to double the lead before half-time. QPR rallied after the interval and Adel Taarabt cut the deficit, but the hosts had Samba Diakite sent off late on. And West Ham held on despite eight yellow cards - a Premier League record. The result, West Ham's first away win of the season, moves Sam Allardyce's side up to seventh in the table and there was more cause for optimism as striker Andy Carroll played the final 20 minutes after returning from his hamstring problem. But this was another damaging defeat for winless QPR, who have now taken only two league points from a possible 18 this season. Having been backed heavily by owner Tony Fernandes during the summer transfer window, the pressure is likely to mount on manager Mark Hughes, who will in turn point to a string of defensive injuries. Sharper to the ball and swifter to use it, West Ham dominated the opening 45 minutes. QPR finally found their rythym in the second half, inspired by the creativity and energy of Taarabt, but it was too little, too late. West Ham worked hard and counter-attacked intelligently, using the energy of Mohamed Diame and the guile of Vaz Te, but it was by no means a classic performance and both of their goals owed more to perspiration than inspiration. Their first came as early as the third minute after Vaz Te skipped beyond a desperate lunge from Clint Hill on the right. The Portuguese cut the ball back to Kevin Nolan on the edge of the area and his looping cross was headed in by Jarvis at the back post. QPR threatened in fits and starts, with Bobby Zamora firing well over from 12 yards and Djibril Cisse drawing an acrobatic save from Jussi Jaaskelainen with an athletic volley. But West Ham remained the better side and the second goal followed soon after. James Tomkins lofted the ball to the back post after QPR failed to clear from a corner and Vaz Te stretched out his right leg, with the ball beating goalkeeper Julio Cesar thanks to the slightest deflection off Stephane Mbia's arm. QPR responded to their manager's half-time words with the kind of spirit and energy that they had been lacking. Taarabt shattered the mediocrity with the game's single moment of brilliance, unleashing a fizzing 30-yarder that flashed into the top corner, 84 seconds after coming on as a substitute. West Ham's Jaaskelainen was the busier of the two goalkeepers now, saving brilliantly from Esteban Granero's shot after a clever touch by Cisse, although Carlton Cole should have made the victory more comfortable for West Ham but prodded wide with the goal at his mercy after a slide-rule pass by the tireless Nolan. But just as QPR came again, Diakite lunged in on Vaz Te to collect a second yellow card, 25 minutes after coming on as a substitute, to take the wind out of QPR's sails.  West Ham manager Sam Allardyce said: "We've achieved our first Barclays Premier League away win, which is no mean feat for a newly promoted team. I think the outstanding qualities we showed, both in our ability to take the game to the opposition away from home and our ability to score goals. were fantastic to see. "As the underdogs, having just been promoted, to come to QPR and take the game to them and dominate that first half was great. If I had to say anything, I was a little bit disappointed we didn't get more than two. "There were an awful lot of fouls and decisions the referee gave that he didn't need to do and an awful lot of yellow cards he gave nearly spoilt the game."

24.04.2013 23:34:14 Luke Moore's fifth goal of the season rescued a point for Swansea against Norwich at Carrow Road. Michael Turner put the Canaries ahead early in the second half after Robert Snodgrass equalised Michu's opener for Swansea. And the Spanish midfielder missed a glorious chance to give Swansea all three points in added time. The result leaves Norwich in 13th place, still only five points clear of the relegation places. It was Norwich's fifth draw in their last six home matches, and their continued failure to open a comfortable gap over the teams in the bottom three will be a worry for manager Chris Hughton. For much of the second half they looked the stronger team after Swansea dominated possession for the opening 50 minutes. But the Canaries could not find a decisive third goal, and Swansea should have taken all three points when top scorer Michu fired over from seven yards in stoppage time. It was another entertaining match for the neutral observer - the last four matches between these sides in the Premier League have now produced 20 goals. Midfielder Leon Britton was left out of the Swansea line-up following the birth of his twin sons. Manager Michael Laudrup gave Moore his third start of the season, while Norwich had goalkeeper Mark Bunn back in action after missing one game following his red card against Sunderland. And they were quickly in action as Bunn saved from Moore after Michu's pass had put the striker into a little space at the edge of the 18-yard box. And Michu had the ball in the back of the net, but the goal was ruled out because of Moore's foul on Jonathan Howson. Bunn was forced to leave the field with a groin injury in the 15th minute, with Lee Camp taking over in goal. The Canaries' best chance fell to Michael Turner after Snodgrass had made inroads on the Swansea left - Michel Vorm saving well from the defender's scuffed half-volley from six yards. In fact, Snodgrass had a good argument for a penalty in the build-up as he appeared to be pushed by Wayne Routledge. Swansea dominated possession and took the lead in the 35th minute as Nathan Dyer, Chico Flores and Jonathan De Guzman teed up Michu who blasted his 21st goal of the season into the roof of the net. Dyer fluffed a golden chance a few minutes later, and Swansea were immediately punished as Kei Kamara freed Elliott Bennett whose cross was headed into an open goal by the unmarked Snodgrass. The goal gave Norwich new impetus, and they finished the half stronger with Kamara firing a shot over the bar. Swansea started the second half in complete control, with Camp forced into a point-blank save from Moore after Wayne Routledge had outfoxed the defence, but Norwich made light of their lack of possession to stun the Swans. Bennett was again the provider, his right-footed free kick catching the Swansea defence flat-footed, and Michael Turner fired in a fine shot on the half-volley to give the Canaries the lead. Swansea were rocking, with the home side displaying the greater hunger. But the game swung again as the visitors manufactured an opening for Moore, who fired in his fifth goal of the season from six yards after Angel Rangel headed across the box. Both teams pressed for the win in the dying minutes, with Michu's added-time miss the closest either side came.  Norwich manager Chris Hughton:  "We wanted a win but nothing changes, we still have to get enough points from the six remaining matches to make sure we're secure. "Their camp might look at it a little bit differently, but I thought on the balance of play it was a fair result. I couldn't fault the team for their endeavour, we got ourselves in scoring positions but unfortunately we conceded two soft goals. "We spoke about the goals we conceded, which I felt were poor to concede, but we gave ourselves opportunities to score and that is what we have found difficult."  Swansea manager Michael Laudrup:  "We dominated completely for the first 30 minutes, [it was] a great goal from Michu. And then out of nowhere we let Norwich come back into the game a couple of bad decisions and suddenly they equalised. "We started the first 10 minutes of the second half well and then suddenly we're 2-1 down because of some misunderstanding or bad marking at a set-piece. "I think it's important to come back with a positive result because... we have two weeks now before the next game against Southampton, which for me we have to win if we want to end up in the top 10."

24.04.2013 23:34:14 Darren Bent came off the bench to rescue a late point for Aston Villa against local rivals West Brom. The England striker swept home following a corner on 80 minutes and almost stole a winner when he fired over soon after. Earlier, Shane Long missed a header but then turned in James Morrison's cross to put West Brom ahead. Although the game had few chances, West Brom's Romelu Lukaku twice went close as the match opened up later on. First, the substitute's late shot clipped the post after it was deflected and then following Bent's goal, the Belgian striker was denied by Brad Guzan. Gabriel Tamas also shaved the bar, as West Brom continued their positive start to the season, with Steve Clarke's team remaining sixth in the Premier League table. Bent's 150th league goal was the perfect response to being left out of the starting line-up and his replacement Christian Benteke did little to inspire confidence in a Villa side who showed plenty of creativity in the first half but lacked the incisiveness to match. Paul Lambert's mixed beginning to his Villa reign looked to be improving after the midweek defeat of Manchester City in the Capital One Cup. And although there was plenty to encourage the Villa fans in this game, they still look some way short of where they would like to be having won just once in the league after six games. Their most promising openings in a busy first half came from midfielder Brett Holman, who twice tested West Brom keeper Ben Foster - and it is clear that Gabriel Agbonlahor and Benteke need more games to flourish properly. West Brom remain at the top end of the table based on three home wins and this, a second point away from home, but they had a great early chance to take control of the game when Long headed wide from five yards. That opportunity, coming from a nod back from Chris Brunt's cross on five minutes, was during a decent early spell where Clarke's side exploited Villa's lack of width. But Lambert's decision to pack his midfield looked a smart one as they began to take control of the game, and the energetic Holman struck a sweetly hit shot that Foster tipped over, with the Australian bursting down the inside left channel to again be denied by the West Brom keeper. Benteke also had a decent chance after robbing Billy Jones on the sideline but, when he advanced towards goal, he shot way over. Jones suffered an innocuous knee injury before half-time and was replaced while Chris Brunt also pulled a hamstring. That had little effect on the visitors though, as they went ahead just after the break. The clever-running Morrison was put in down the right and, although Ron Vlaar slid to clear his centre, Long was lurking behind him to tuck in. Villa responded, and although they introduced Bent, Charles N'Zogbia and Barry Bannan, they could not reach the same standards of the first half. Then, as the game reached its conclusion, Bent once again proved his undoubted value by pinching an equaliser 12 minutes after coming off the bench. From a corner, Ciaran Clark's effort was blocked but when it fell to the striker eight yards out, he lashed a left-footed shot in. Bent and then Lukaku could both have changed the outcome before the full-time whistle, but former St Mirren team-mates Clarke and Lambert would both have been content with a point.  West Brom boss Steve Clarke: "Having been 1-0 in front and with decent control of the game for long parts we are a bit disappointed not to win but then again, if you said before that we would come away from a difficult away game with a point then we would have taken that. "The start has been pleasing but we are not getting carried away. Maybe that is a measure of how far we have come that we are coming away from Villa Park with a point and feeling disappointed."

24.04.2013 23:34:14 Tottenham ended their 23-year wait for a victory at Old Trafford as they held on to take the points against Manchester United in a pulsating encounter. Spurs looked to be in total control after first-half goals from Jan Vertonghen and Gareth Bale gave them a comfortable advantage at the break. But United, who were awful in the first period, hit back through Nani before Clint Dempsey restored Tottenham's two-goal advantage. Shinji Kagawa immediately struck again for United as they poured forward in a bid to maintain their long unbeaten run against Spurs. United pressed hard with substitute Wayne Rooney and Michael Carrick hitting the woodwork and they saw several appeals for a penalty waved away by referee Chris Foy. It was a victory which delighted the large contingent of Tottenham fans who last saw their side win at Old Trafford in 1989 when Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker scored the winner for Terry Venables' side. For United, it was their second defeat in six Premier League games, and manager Sir Alex Ferguson could have more defensive injury problems after Jonny Evans finished the game in some discomfort. Watching England manager Roy Hodgson will not have seen anything to change his mind about not picking United defender Rio Ferdinand for "footballing reasons" since taking over from Fabio Capello. Ferdinand struggled against Tottenham's dangerous forward line and he did virtually nothing to boost his chances of a call-up for the World Cup qualifiers against San Marino and Poland in a fortnight. Tottenham stunned the vast majority of the 75,566 crowd inside two minutes when they took the lead after a neat one-two between Vertonghen and Bale. United backed off and Vertonghen burst into the penalty area and evaded a half-hearted Ferdinand challenge before striking a low shot which deflected into the net off Evans. It was a lead Spurs deserved as they took the game to United who barely had a touch in the opening 10 minutes. Tottenham looked assured and totally in control with Dempsey and Mousa Dembele dominating in the centre against a largely ineffective Ryan Giggs and Paul Scholes. With United struggling to make any impression inside the visitors' territory, Spurs doubled their lead with a fabulous goal which sliced a hole straight down the heart of the home defence. Dembele broke from the halfway line and slipped the ball to Bale who ran on and ghosted through the United defence before hitting a cool finish past Anders Lindegaard. With Wayne Rooney on for Giggs after the break, United predictably picked up their pace as they went in search of a goal and it was not long before the game took an incredible twist with three goals in just 139 seconds. United broke through when Rooney crossed for Nani to fire home from six yards but Tottenham immediately restored their two-goal advantage when Bale's fierce shot was only half-saved by Lindegaard allowing Dempsey to tap in. A fifth goal followed seconds later as United swept up field and Kagawa slotted in their second from Robin van Persie's slide-rule pass. United continued to surge forward and Rooney was unlucky with a sweetly struck free-kick which crashed back off the woodwork before Van Persie had an effort which was correctly ruled offside. Tottenham had to dig deep into their defensive reserves as United, with Danny Welbeck on for Kagawa, pressed forward in search of an equaliser. There were several penalty appeals, including what looked like a handball by Sandro, and a number of near misses as Michael Carrick's header glanced off the woodwork. Tottenham took the sting out of United's forward runs and in the end they just about deserved their victory.

24.04.2013 23:34:14 Two goals by Nikica Jelavic continued Everton's flying start to the season as David Moyes's side came from behind to seal a fourth win in six league games. Record Â£12m signing Gaston Ramirez gave Southampton the lead at Goodison with a header from Adam Lallana's corner. But Leon Osman levelled from eight yards after a cross by Kevin Mirallas, who then threaded a pass for Croatian striker Jelavic to make it 2-1. Jelavic cemented victory with a header after good work by Seamus Coleman. While Southampton have now conceded an alarming 18 goals in six Premier League games, Everton's latest success adds weight to the belief that Moyes's men can challenge for Champions League qualification. The hosts, now up to second in the table, displayed great character to recover from a desperate start to score all three goals in the space of 13 first-half minutes and leave the Saints longing for the half-time whistle. On the eve of the match, Moyes, in the final year of his Goodison Park contract, ruled out imminent discussions to resolve his long-term future, the Scot insisting he was more concerned with concentrating on his team's healthy start than sorting out his own future. But Blues fans will be anxious chairman Bill Kenwright secures Moyes's signature in the coming weeks before another club comes knocking for the 49-year-old. Everton's sixth win in seven home league games was achieved the hard way after the Saints took a shock lead. While Moyes will be delighted to start October near the Premier League summit, he will have been unimpressed with the shabby defending that allowed Ramirez, who was totally unmarked, to head Lallana's sixth minute corner beyond Tim Howard. John Heitinga was presented with a chance to equalise moments later but headed straight at keeper Paulo Gazzaniga before Jay Rodriguez flashed the ball across the face of the Toffees' six-yard area in a thoroughly entertaining clash. It proved a costly miss by the former Burnley man, Everton regrouping to turn the game upside down with three quick goals. Midfielder Osman lashed the ball home from eight yards after the Southampton defence made a hash of trying to clear Mirallas's dangerous cross. With Marouane Fellaini oozing confidence and Jelavic in fine form, it was only a matter of time before the hosts took the lead. Jelvavic made it 2-1 from an acute angle after Mirallas's beautifully threaded pass. The former Rangers man then netted his third league goal of the season, a powerful header at the back post which Gazzaniga got a hand to but could not keep out. Southampton rallied after half-time - Rickie Lambert and Ramirez both going close. But the Toffees were worthy winners, Fellaini heading against the bar before Osman and Mirallas both went close to increasing the lead. Everton, notorious slow starters, are helping set the pace heading into October.

24.04.2013 23:34:14 Edin Dzeko scored a minute after coming off the bench to give Manchester City a dramatic late win over Fulham. The Cottagers took an early lead when Pablo Zabaleta was adjudged to have fouled John Arne Riise in the area and Mladen Petric slammed home the penalty. Fulham keeper Mark Schwarzer made a series of fine saves before Sergio Aguero levelled from close range. And City were unable to turn pressure into chances before Dzeko slammed home a Gael Clichy cross in the 87th minute. The champions had failed to triumph in their four previous games in all competitions, so this was a welcome return to winning ways for Roberto Mancini's men - especially because it seemed victory was set to elude them again. Despite his side's uncertain start to the defence of their title, Mancini declared this week that they would win the league again this season - but on this evidence they still lack the fluidity in front of goal that was so vital to that success. Their cause in west London was not helped by the questionable early penalty awarded to Fulham by referee Mark Halsey, who was at the centre of controversy last weekend when he made a police complaint after receiving insulting Tweets following his decisions in Manchester United's win over Liverpool.  There was minimal contact from Zabaleta's hand on Riise's midriff as the Fulham defender cut into the area, but it was enough to send Riise tumbling to the ground and, after Halsey pointed to the spot, Petric made no mistake with his penalty. Any sense of injustice over that decision did not fuel an immediate response from City, who saw plenty of the ball but made few inroads into the Fulham area as they searched for a leveller. In fact, the Cottagers were looking more dangerous on the break, with Petric wasting a decent sight of goal when he blazed over from the edge of the box after good work by Hugo Rodallega down the left. Only around the half-hour mark did City begin to seriously threaten and Aguero should have done better when David Silva's corner was flicked on to him at the back post, only to nod into the side netting. One of Mancini's problems with his side this season has been their failure to take chances like that one, but the main reason City had to wait to equalise was the form of Schwarzer rather than any more poor finishing. Clichy fired a rasping shot at the veteran Fulham keeper from the edge of the area, the Australian denied Tevez by diving to recover the ball on his line after a goalmouth scramble, and was at full length to keep out Silva's low shot. Even for City's goal, Schwarzer made another inspired stop to keep out the touch Silva got on Tevez's deflected strike, but he could do nothing to stop Aguero following up to tap home from close range. The visitors continued to dominate possession after the break but the chances dried up. Aguero saw a glancing header drift wide and Zabaleta and substitute Mario Balotelli both curled efforts just off target, and it appeared Fulham's well-organised defence would hold out for a point until Dzeko replaced Javi Garcia with four minutes left. Sixty-six seconds later, Clichy sent over a dangerous cross from the left and Riise's attempt to clear only succeeded in finding Dzeko, who took a touch before firing a powerful shot into the roof of the net.  Fulham boss Martin Jol on Riise's mistake for City's winner: "It was a mistimed ball. I would hit it with my right foot instead of trying to head it. It was a bad clearance. "I think he will be disappointed because the mistake he made they punished. "They are a very good team but there is always a possibility against them to play your football like, for example, Arsenal did last week. "We couldn't play our style, especially in the second half. We couldn't keep the ball, they were stronger than us and more eager to score. "The only thing we could do was defend, defend, defend and that is probably not enough if you would like a result against them."

24.04.2013 23:34:14 Luis Suarez scored a hat-trick to lead Liverpool to their first Premier League win of the season as they beat Norwich. Suarez drilled in a strike from the edge of the box before stroking in a second following a defensive mistake. The Uruguayan set up Nuri Sahin for a tap-in and Suarez curled in shot for his hat-trick before Steve Morison drove in an effort for the home side. Steven Gerrard's deflected strike added Liverpool's fifth, while Grant Holt angled in a shot for a late home goal. It is the second hat-trick Suarez has scored at Carrow Road in consecutive seasons and was the culmination of a Liverpool display in which they had passed and purred their way to victory. The "ole"'s were ringing out from the Reds fans towards the end of the game and, while an inspired Suarez will rightly steal the headlines, 18-year-old playmaker Suso also caught the eye. He was making his first Premier League start along with right-back Andre Wisdom. Liverpool, like Norwich, had argued that their performances had not been reflected in results but neither side could have any such complaints after a game in which the Canaries succumbed to their dominant visitors. The home side did not help themselves with the type of poor defending which led to Liverpool's opener. Canaries centre-back Michael Turner could only clear Glen Johnson's pass to Suarez and he clinically drilled a shot into the bottom corner. The visitors were swarming all over the home side, but Simeon Jackson had a chance to provide Norwich with a lifeline. He met a cross to the far post with a first-time shot only for Reds keeper Pepe Reina to smartly save. Jackson also volleyed wide for Norwich and an equaliser would have given Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers another reason to complain to referees' chief Mike Riley again as, earlier on, Suarez was denied a penalty following a clumsy Leon Barnett challenge. Gerrard had a header saved before Suarez should have had his second when he was clean through on goal only to put his effort wide. The Liverpool striker quickly made amends as he caught a napping Turner in possession and curled a shot past keeper John Ruddy with the outside of his foot. Norwich boss Chris Hughton sent on Holt after the break but, when Andrew Surman's shot ricocheted over off Robert Snodgrass from a yard out, he must have feared the worst - and rightly so. The home side's tormentor Suarez turned from goalscorer to provider as he crossed for midfielder Sahin, who was rewarded with a start after his two goals in the midweek League Cup win over West Brom, to slide in a close-range shot to put the Reds 3-0 up. Liverpool's emphasis on the passing game under Rodgers was reaping its rewards after a difficult start to the campaign and Suarez steered a shot past Ruddy as the Canaries defence stood off him. Morison gave the home side a rare moment of solace when he drove in a shot after Reina parried the ball into his path following a Russell Martin shot. But Liverpool did not allow their hosts any respite as Gerrard's long-range strike deflected off Barnett on the way into the net. Holt scored his first goal of the season as Liverpool took their foot off the gas when he angled a shot into the far corner, although it did little to disguise a comprehensive defeat as the home side were booed off.

24.04.2013 23:34:14 Demba Ba scored twice to rescue a point for Newcastle and deny Reading their first Premier League win of the season. In a match that only came to life just before the hour mark, Jimmy Kebe tucked in Jobi McAnuff's threaded pass. Ba equalised in the same minute when he volleyed in Cheick Tiote's lofted ball. Reading took charge once again minutes later thanks to Noel Hunt's glancing header but Ba then pounced for his sixth goal in six games - although there was a suspicion of handball. Replays showed that his strike, seven minutes from the end, came off his arm following Shane Ferguson's left-wing cross, and Reading's players were quick to protest to referee Andre Marriner. The hosts were also left frustrated as McAnuff hit the post late on with a curling strike, while Steve Harper saved Jason Roberts' effort. A draw for the newly-promoted side might look like a decent result against a strong Newcastle team, and the point moves them off the bottom of the Premier League table. However, Brian McDermott may look back at this game as a missed opportunity given the lethargy on show from the visitors for large parts of the game. It continued a mixed start to the season for Alan Pardew's side, but once again they were saved by some incisive finishing from one of their star strikers, who has now scored 22 goals in 40 Premier League games for the Magpies.  Having declared that the sole remit of his new eight-year contract was to win every week, Pardew might have cause for concern after this encounter and certainly would have been less than impressed by his team's slow start. Without the guile of the ill Yohan Cabaye in midfield, the visitors struggled to retain the ball and it was not until Reading eked out the first real chance of the game on the half hour that they responded. By that stage McDermott's side looked the more fluent of the two teams and, when Pavel Pogrebnyak headed McAnuff's cross towards the top corner, Harper did well to tip it over with his left hand. On Pardew's return to his former club, and having given McDermott his first job at Reading, there was more than a feel of a friendly fixture. That soon changed just before the hour mark when, in complete contrast to the previous inaction, three goals arrived in less than five minutes. And it coincided with a reshuffle in the Newcastle defence as Steven Taylor was replaced by James Tavernier. Reading skipper McAnuff was the creator on both occasions for Reading as he found the onrushing Kebe, who, on his first Premier League start of the season, cut inside to receive the ball and squeezed his shot inside the near post. Amazingly, the lead lasted less than a minute as Ba continued his superb scoring run by expertly taking Tiote's incisive pass to volley in from the edge of the area. The goal flurry continued when McAnuff crossed from the left to find Hunt with a glancing header. At last, Reading settled and it looked like they might hold on for victory, but Ba's controversial goal made it all square again and keeps the Royals in the bottom three.  Reading boss Brian McDermott : "I'm absolutely gutted because we deserved to win the game. When you see [Demba Ba's second goal] back [the officials] have made a massive error. It was going away from goal and the scorer has handballed it into the net. It's a blatant error. "We played fantastically today, that is the identity of our team and we played on the front and even at 2-2 we had chances and I think Alan Pardew would have been pleased with the point."  Newcastle boss Alan Pardew: "We are struggling for rhythm this year, and are not playing with the same exuberance as last year and today was a sign of that. We can't rely on spirit all the time. "No mistake, [Demba Ba's second goal] hit his hand. Shane Ferguson put the ball in a great area, and it hit Demba's head and hit his hand but it's about the delivery of the ball. Reading gave us a going over today, I have no worries about them staying in this division."

24.04.2013 23:34:15 Peter Crouch ended Stoke's search for a Premier League win as they inflicted a third straight defeat on Swansea. Poor Swansea defending from a corner allowed the unmarked Crouch to head home the opener. He then fired in his second from close range after a cross had been muscled towards goal by Jonathan Walters. Danny Graham played in Michu for the visitors' best chance but the striker toe-poked his effort wide from 25 yards. Crouch scored the last winning goal for Stoke against Wolves back in April and this victory was rarely in doubt against a Swansea side almost unrecognisable from the team which started the season with such purpose and guile. This victory ended Stoke's 11-match streak without a win. Tony Pulis, the Stoke manager, will have a wry smile after his so-called 'one-dimensional' Potters side put a Swansea team, known for their passing style, to the sword in such an emphatic fashion. Swansea boss Michael Laudrup saw his side score 10 goals in their first three games, but have now failed to score in their last three matches in the Premier League. Their defensive frailties will be a major concern for him. This match was billed as a clash of very different footballing philosophies, with Stoke's more direct 'route one' approach up against Swansea's trademark 'pass and move' game, which has served them so well in the Premier League. Stoke's renowned aerial threat was evident when Crouch, the former England striker, put the home side ahead when the visitors allowed the 6ft 7ins centre forward a free header from a corner to make it 1-0 after 12 minutes. Swansea goalkeeper Michel Vorm, who signed a new four-year deal at the Liberty Stadium in midweek, was exposed and did not stand a chance as the Welsh side's brittle defence was breached once more. The home side controlled the first half and Vorm's goal was under constant threat. The mere presence of Crouch inside the Swans penalty area caused panic among the visitors' defence. It was Crouch again who took advantage of a speculative cross into the penalty box to stretch his side's lead to 2-0, but it took him two attempts to score his second. Crouch, who made 42 appearances for England, had a chance to grab his hat-trick towards the end of the game but his header, after a good cross by substitute Matthew Etherington hit the bar. Swansea did play with more direction in the second half, but the damage had already been done and Stoke were happy to defend their first-half lead to claim a well-deserved three points.  Stoke manager Tony Pulis: "I thought we played really well in the first half and we didn't want half time to come. Swansea had a good spell after that but we came back at the end. "Peter Crouch was exceptional today and he is unlucky not to have a hat-trick."  Swansea boss Michael Laudrup: "We talked in the week about set-pieces being important and stopping Peter Crouch and we couldn't do that. We haven't scored for three league games in a row so that is something we have to improve on."

24.04.2013 23:34:15 Steven Fletcher's fifth goal in four Premier League games gave Sunderland their first win of the season against 10-man Wigan at the Stadium of Light. The visitors enjoyed the better of the first half but life was made difficult for them when Jordi Gomez was sent off on 48 minutes for a foul on Danny Rose. Sunderland took advantage minutes later as Fletcher drove home from James McClean's ball to seal victory. It was the Black Cats' first Premier League win since March. The home side were given a welcome boost before kick-off as Adam Johnson, who injured his thigh while training with England earlier this month, passed a late fitness test to take make his first appearance at the Stadium of Light since signing for Manchester City last month. Another of Martin O'Neill's new recruits, Fletcher, went into the game having scored all of Sunderland's goals so far in the Premier League and he was almost presented with an opportunity for another inside the first minute when Ali Al-Habsi was caught unawares by the striker, but the Wigan keeper was able to clear just in time. However, it was the visitors who settled into the game more quickly and only a superb save by Simon Mignolet prevented them from taking the lead after 15 minutes. Jean Beausejour's first-time ball across goal found Arouna Kone at the far post, but his point-blank shot was superbly denied by the Belgian. Sunderland came close to opening the scoring with their first real chance on goal in the 26th minute. Fletcher was fouled on the left side of the area and Sebastian Larsson's free-kick looked destined for the goal, but Ivan Ramis was on hand to scramble the ball away. Despite that chance it was the visitors who finished the half stronger as Kone headed over, before James McCarthy's low drive from distance flew just wide of the upright. But the second half was to be a much harder proposition when, on 48 minutes, Gomez was shown a straight red card for a two-footed lunge on Rose. It took the hosts only three minutes to capitalise on their man advantage. McClean scampered down the left towards the area before delivering a low ball towards the far post, where Fletcher raced in to smash an unstoppable drive beyond Al-Habsi. That goal sparked Sunderland into life and they had a couple of chances to add a second minutes later as Stephane Sessegnon first saw his low shot pushed behind by Al-Habsi, before the Benin midfielder was just wide with an effort from McClean's cross. But after that brief flurry of chances, the game descended into a scrappy affair, with both sides struggling to create inside the final third.  Sunderland manager Martin O'Neill: "We have the win and we are unbeaten so far this season. Steven Fletcher was fantastic, not just scoring the goal but his overall centre-forward play. He was terrific, he is a really fine player. "I am not concerned that our goals are only coming from him at the moment, but I think in time that if he is the one who continues to score for us and no-one else does then that might become a problem. A lot of others are doing good things for us in this run and it will come in time. "Having a player sent off like Wigan did today does mean you have to re-adjust. During the week in the Capital One Cup, when we lost Lee Cattermole, I am sure that gave MK Dons a major boost and I am sure that is what happened for us in this game."  Wigan manager Roberto Martinez: "I thought we were the better side in the first half and it was a shame we could not convert any of our chances. "We tried to push on and put Sunderland under pressure but the things that went against us I don't think we could have done much to control them. "Every defeat is a concern, you don't want to lose games and it is as simple as that. I thought our first half performance showed we are a team who create opportunities. There was nothing we could do about this 90 minutes and now we must concentrate on our next game."

24.04.2013 23:34:15 Chelsea stayed top of the Premier League table after inflicting Arsenal's first defeat of the season at Emirates Stadium. Chelsea captain John Terry started as he decides whether to appeal against the four-match ban and Â£220,000 fine imposed by the Football Association after he was found guilty of racially abusing QPR's Anton Ferdinand.  And he played his part in a victory that was set up by Fernando Torres's clever early strike as he stole in behind Laurent Koscielny to steer in Juan Mata's free-kick. Gervinho's powerful finish put Arsenal level before the interval but Roberto Di Matteo's side claimed the points early in the second half when Mata's long-range free-kick took the slightest touch off Koscielny and beat Vito Mannone before he could react. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger regarded this match of a measure of his side's title potential - and they had the opportunity to rescue a point only to find Chelsea keeper Petr Cech in defiant mood. He saved brilliantly from Lukas Podolski's second-half header and produced a superb reflex save from Olivier Giroud's deflected shot, the France striker also missing a great stoppage-time opportunity when he hit the side-netting after evading Cech's challenge. The Blues will see this as a landmark win as Di Matteo continues to shift the emphasis in personnel and tactical approach after May's Champions League triumph. He demonstrated attacking intent by field Oscar, Mata and Eden Hazard from the start - a selection that restricted Frank Lampard to a place on the bench. Inevitably, Terry's every touch was jeered by Arsenal fans as was that of former Gunners defender Ashley Cole - six years after his move to Chelsea. It was the visitors, however, who settled better and took the lead after 20 minutes through a goal that was a combination of dreadful Arsenal defending and the opportunism of Torres, who easily escaped the flimsy attentions of Koscielny at the far post to hook his finish past Mannone. Torres should have doubled his side's lead soon after when he raced clear with only the keeper to beat but he hesitated and could only manage a fresh air shot under challenge from Koscielny, with his subsequent appeals for a penalty ignored. The home side's rhythm had not been helped by the early loss of Abou Diaby with a hip injury but they forced their way back into the game with Gervinho's equaliser three minutes before the break. The striker collected substitute Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's cross and punished Terry for retreating too far towards his own goal with a fine finish high past Cech. Arsenal's improved defensive work under Wenger's new assistant Steve Bould has drawn much praise this season but once again they were sloppy as Chelsea regained the lead after 53 minutes. Thomas Vermaelen was penalised for fouling Torres and the punishment was complete as Mata's angled free-kick took a slight touch off Koscielny to drift beyond Mannone into the bottom corner. Cech had not been overworked in the first half but excelled in clawing away Podolski's header and then saving from Giroud's deflected effort after he had replaced the Germany striker. Chelsea threatened on the break without testing Mannone but the best chance fell to Giroud in injury time, the France striker rounding Cech but hitting the side-netting from a tight angle. It was the final act and Terry celebrated by advancing towards celebrating Chelsea fans after the final whistle and handing his boots to a youngster in the crowd.

24.04.2013 23:34:15 Laurent Koscielny scored a late equaliser as Arsenal came from behind to snatch a well-earned point from a breathless encounter with Manchester City. The Frenchman found the net nine minutes from time, thumping in from close range after the champions had failed to clear the danger from a corner. City had taken a scarcely deserved lead when Joleon Lescott headed in David Silva's corner five minutes before the break. But Arsenal kept going to salvage a point from a match that maintains both clubs' unbeaten starts to the season and leaves them locked together on eight points from five matches. City manager Roberto Mancini cut a fraught and frustrated figure throughout the game, as City once again failed to recreate the attacking fluency that became their trademark in the early months of last season. He could only bring himself to describe his side's Premier League campaign as "satisfactory" in his programme notes before the game. Against Arsenal there was little evidence to persuade him to change his verdict. Life has not been easy for his opposite number Arsene Wenger these past few years. With Robin van Persie joining the recent exodus of star players from the Emirates Stadium, a sense of anguish among the north London side's supporters is understandable. But this was an accomplished performance, made all the more satisfying by the contributions of Santi Cazorla and Aaron Ramsey. The Arsenal faithful even mocked their City counterparts' "Poznan" celebration, by turning their backs to the pitch and bouncing up and down when Koscielny found the net. And at the final whistle the overwhelming emotion in their section was a sense of pride in the continuing improvement of their team. If the scarcely believable events against Real Madrid at the Bernebeu on Tuesday night had left City deflated and leggy, Arsenal did their best to exploit it during a frantic first half. Using the energy of Abou Diaby and the guile of Cazorla, Wenger's side were sharper to the ball and swifter to use it, but yet somehow still found themselves behind at the interval. With Yaya Toure restricted to a deep-lying midfield role and Javi Garcia largely ineffectual, Arsenal bossed the midfield battle early on, with Ramsey and Mikel Arteta pulling the strings. It was Arteta's Spanish compatriot Cazorla, however, who really caught the eye. Whether dribbling or passing the ball, he showed once again that he has the alertness and imagination to see and exploit openings of which others have no inkling. He was at the heart of Arsenal's most creative moments, combining with Ramsey to put Gervinho in behind the City defence after 16 minutes, only for the forward's first touch to desert him. Cazorla twice tested City keeper Joe Hart with shots of his own, once from open play and once from a free-kick, as Arsenal attempted to convert their dominance into goals. Gervinho found space again only to shoot into the side netting, while a low cross by Gibbs skidded across the six-yard line as City defenders willed it to safety. Only Sergio Aguero, on his return to the side, carried a potent attacking threat. The Argentina striker tested Arsenal goalkeeper Vito Mannone with a wicked low shot after 13 minutes, but it was not until Mancini switched Scott Sinclair, making his home debut, to the right flank that City's luck changed. The home side's goal was straightforward; Silva's 40th-minute corner was headed in by Lescott as Koscielny and Lukas Podolski stood by and Mannone came and missed. Captain Thomas Vermaelen, absent with flu, may just have made the difference. The goal woke City from their slumber. Mannone went some way to making up for his error by tipping a fierce Edin Dzeko shot just over the crossbar before half-time and City's momentum continued after the break. Aguero might have gone to ground in colliding with Koscielny in the penalty area. The City striker, to his credit, stayed on his feet only for his shot to be deflected to safety when a penalty might have been greater reward. Arsenal were far from finished, however, as City retreated deeper and deeper, happy to strike from distance. Cazorla drew a stunning save from Hart with a shot that appeared destined for the top corner. But Arsenal were not denied for long, finally getting their reward as Koscielny found the net with a thunderous shot after City had failed to clear the resulting corner. Vincent Kompany almost restored the lead immediately with a dramatic overhead kick, with Aguero forcing a follow-up narrowly wide. Gervinho might have won it for Arsenal as the clock ticked into injury time, only for his shot to fly high and wide. It was hard not to imagine what might have been had Wenger been able to call on the services of a world class striker, like Van Persie, to finish off so much of his team's good work.

24.04.2013 23:34:15 Aston Villa moved out of the relegation zone by beating Stoke, whose own survival prospects took a blow. Gabriel Agbonlahor gave Villa the lead when he side-footed in from close range at the second attempt. Villa almost added a second when Andreas Weimann's effort came back off the post, before Michael Kightly slammed in a shot to level for Stoke. But a spectacular Matthew Lowton strike restored Villa's lead and Christian Benteke slotted in to wrap up the win. It was a storming finish to the game from Villa as they claimed a third victory in four games to lift them three points above the relegation zone. Wins for Wigan and Sunderland on Sunday could see Paul Lambert's side fall back into the bottom three, but this performance will give Villa plenty of confidence for the run-in. In contrast, Stoke have won only once in their last 13 league outings and find themselves just four points from the bottom three, with their form and confidence looking increasingly fragile. The Potters had an early penalty appeal turned down when a Jon Walters cross hit the arm of Villa defender Nathan Baker, and matters soon got worse for Tony Pulis's men. Hesitant defending proved the home side's downfall as Villa took advantage of their let-off to quickly take the lead. Lowton combined with Jordan Bowery on the right flank before firing in a low cross for Agbonlahor, who scored after his initial shot came back off Geoff Cameron. Stoke looked shocked and Bowery, 21, almost capitalised when he ran at the flailing home defence and curled an 18-yard shot into the side-netting. Villa now had a firm grip on the game and again came close to a second when Weimann was denied by the woodwork. Agbonlahor slipped a pass inside to release his fellow forward and the Austrian's low side-footed shot came back off the foot of the post, Potters keeper Asmir Begovic appearing to get a vital touch. Agbonlahor then thought he should have had a penalty, racing through on goal before going down as he skipped past the outstretched leg of Begovic. The Villa striker was instead booked for diving. Stoke were booed off at half-time and the Potters produced nothing to improve their fans' mood after the interval. Instead, it was Villa who again went close when left-back Joe Bennett found Bowery, who got past Marc Wilson too easily but saw his shot blocked by Begovic. Stoke, in danger of finishing bottom of the Premier League scoring charts for a second successive season, failed to make any real chances until a belated rally produced an equaliser. Midfielder Charlie Adam helped on a Walters pass to fellow sub Kightly, who fired in from 12 yards. But it was a false dawn for the home side as Villa responded with Lowton's superb strike, the right-back chesting down a clearance 30 yards out and volleying spectacularly into the top corner. Benteke completed the win when he broke clear late on and side-footed past Begovic.

24.04.2013 23:34:15 Tottenham scored twice in as many minutes as they fought back to beat Queens Park Rangers and record their first home win of the season. Bobby Zamora gave QPR the lead against his old club during a first half in which Spurs were decidedly lacklustre. But a formation change brought about an improvement in fortunes as an Alejandro Faurlin own goal levelled matters before Jermain Defoe struck the winner. The win moves Spurs up to eighth in the Premier League while QPR remain 19th. The home side had gone into the game looking for a second successive victory, having won 3-1 at Reading last time out.  QPR, meanwhile, were without a win in the league so far this season, and things did not start well for Mark Hughes's side as they were forced into making a third-minute change when Jose Bosingwa hobbled off with a hamstring injury. He was replaced at right-back by Kieron Dyer and the former Newcastle midfielder's introduction had an almost immediate effect. The 33-year-old earned QPR's first corner of the game, which Esteban Granero whipped into the box. Clint Hill launched himself at the ball, but his powerful header was superbly palmed away by Brad Friedel. The visitors continued to enjoy the better of the opening stages and Spurs again had Friedel to thank for keeping the scores level when he saved Junior Hoilett's  volleyed effort. Tottenham struggled to make possession count in the final third, failing to manage a single shot on target during the opening exchanges, and it came as little surprise when QPR took the lead 12 minutes before the break. A seventh corner of the half was only partially cleared before Faurlin received the ball just outside the area. He feigned to shoot before slipping the ball through the defence to Zamora, who turned quickly and lifted the ball over Friedel from close range. Looking to instigate an upturn in form, Spurs boss Andre Villas-Boas replaced Gylfi Sigurdsson with Steven Caulker at the start of the second half and changed to a 4-4-2 formation, with Clint Dempsey partnering Defoe in attack. The switch worked and Spurs finally managed their first shot on target as Dempsey's 30-yard effort was pushed away by Julio Cesar. Gareth Bale was also becoming increasingly effective and he was instrumental in turning the game on its head as Tottenham scored two goals in quick succession. The first arrived on the hour as Bale's corner was headed back towards goal by Caulker and Faurlin, unsighted by Defoe, compounded to knock the ball into his own net. Barely 90 seconds later, Tottenham were ahead as a QPR attack broke down and the hosts embarked on a quick counter. The impressive Jan Vertonghen fed a pass to Bale on the left of the area and though his shot cannoned back off the underside of the bar, the ball fell to the unmarked Defoe, who made no mistake. Suddenly the game was wide open and Hoilett was denied a 72nd-minute equaliser when he was unmarked inside the area but Vertonghen slid in from nowhere to clear. But as QPR tired Spurs took control and Hill twice denied Defoe to prevent the margin of victory from being greater.  Spurs manager Andre Villas-Boas:  "I am extremely happy. The team fought very hard to get this win and the feeling we have at the moment is very gratifying. We have been looking for this for some time and the players put on the performance in the second half to help us get this win. "They found spaces in our defence in the first half and all credit to them. We couldn't close them down but in the second half the players were really committed to showing more for the ball and we got the 2-1 we deserved. "We felt we needed to make changes at half time. Gareth Bale played better as a left winger than as a left back and he made a difference for us. The players really, really wanted to win this game for the fans and it was more their will that took us through in the second half."  QPR manager Mark Hughes:  "We are scratching our heads somewhat to understand why we didn't get anything out of the game because the manner of our performance, particularly in the first half was very good. "We came here and took the game to Tottenham, dominated the first 45 minutes and we were 1-0 to the good. In the second half they had to rejig to get back into the game, we gave them a helping hand with the own goal and then they got the second. "But overall in terms of level of performance it was at the level I feel we need to be in the Premier League."

24.04.2013 23:34:15 Demba Ba scored his third goal in two games to spoil Norwich manager Chris Hughton's return to Newcastle.  Ba scored twice after coming on as a substitute against Everton on Monday, and he marked his return to the starting line-up by converting Hatem Ben Arfa's defence-splitting pass. Papiss Cisse could not add to Ba's goal when he missed a first-half penalty. Wes Hoolahan and Andrew Surman wasted chances for Norwich, who have yet to win in the league this season. It was a deserved victory for Newcastle, who should have won more convincingly, while Hughton, who was sacked as Magpies manager in December 2010 despite leading them to promotion months earlier, will be concerned by his side's ongoing problems in front of goal. The Canaries, who lost defender Sebastien Bassong to a hamstring injury after just six minutes, did create some decent chances but their composure was missing - something that cannot be said about Ba at the moment. The 27-year-old striker, whose agent upset manager Alan Pardew with comments suggesting Ba may want a move away from Newcastle, scored against the run of play with a well-worked goal which was direct in definition but exquisite in its execution. Goalkeeper Steve Harper, deputising for the injured Tim Krul, rolled the ball out to Ben Arfa who glided forward before splitting the Norwich defence with a sublime pass which Ba latched onto and, with his second touch, clinically placed the ball past John Ruddy and into the back of the net. The goal summed up much of Newcastle's play, with Ben Arfa regularly picking the ball up in the deep and causing the Canaries defence problems with his mixture of inch-perfect passing and mazy dribbling. The French midfielder almost set up Ba and Cisse on two other occasions - with the Senegalese pair experiencing contrasting fortunes. While Ba appeared to be buoyed by his strike, his partner is now without a goal in six matches this season. And his effort for the penalty, won when Mike Williamson was backed into and knocked over by Steve Morison, summed up his day - the ball never threatening the goal as it soared high into the stand. Hughton's decision to bring in Hoolahan and Morison to replace Grant Holt and Simeon Jackson did not bear dividends, and the Canaries have now scored only twice in five Premier League matches. Left-back Javier Garrido was their best attacking option, with the former Manchester City man creating two useful chances for Hoolahan and Robert Snodgrass, but they struggled to assert themselves after they had fallen behind. Their best chance came at the beginning of the second half when Harper denied Andrew Surman after the midfielder had been put clean through on goal. Hughton sent on Holt and Jackson, but it was the hosts who looked more threatening in the final stages as Ba was put through by Cabaye and saw his shot saved by Ruddy before the keeper denied Gabriel Obertan in stoppage time. Victory moves Newcastle up to 10th in the Premier League table while Norwich, who face Liverpool, Chelsea and Arsenal in their next three league games, remain just above the relegation zone.

24.04.2013 23:34:15 Robin van Persie's late penalty gave Manchester United victory over Liverpool on a poignant afternoon at Anfield. On an occasion when the Hillsborough victims and families were remembered in moving scenes before kick-off, these two great rivals produced a typically competitive and contentious encounter. Liverpool were reduced to 10 men when Jonjo Shelvey was sent off for a first-half foul on United defender Jonny Evans - but it did not stop captain Steven Gerrard volleying them ahead seconds after the interval. United, barely in the game for long periods, responded with a spectacular equaliser from Rafael Da Silva before Van Persie confirmed a fourth straight Premier League win nine minutes from time after Glen Johnson fouled Antonio Valencia. It left Liverpool and new manager Brendan Rodgers without a league win in five attempts this season and in the Premier League's bottom three, once again rueing their lack of cutting edge. Liverpool enjoyed spells of complete domination in territory and possession but failed to make it count, leaving United, who were without centre-back Nemanja Vidic, the opportunity to take full advantage for their first win at Anfield in six games. As expected, Anfield was an emotional arena after the recent publication of the findings of an independent panel investigating the disaster at the 1989 FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest. The panel cleared Liverpool's supporters of blame and the build-up to kick-off was marked with a series of tributes to commemorate the occasion. Supporters arrived hours before the start to lay floral tributes at Anfield's Eternal Flame Hillsborough memorial and The Kop was emblazoned with a mosaic reading "The Truth" while the word "Justice" decorated the lower Centenary Stand. Manchester United legend Sir Bobby Charlton then presented flowers to Liverpool's record goalscorer Ian Rush as opposing captains Gerrard and Ryan Giggs released 96 red balloons in memory of those who lost their lives. The ceremonies were impeccably observed by both sets of supporters, as was the ritual of the pre-match handshake between Luis Suarez and Patrice Evra.  There was no repeat of last season's scene at Old Trafford when the Uruguayan, who had been found guilty of racially abusing the United defender, refused the Frenchman's hand. When the action did start Liverpool exerted complete control of the first half but could not find the finishing touch to compliment their fine approach work. Gerrard was closest with a shot narrowly off target at the near post as United struggled to find any fluency. Liverpool's flow was disrupted in the 39th minute when they lost Shelvey as he was shown a straight red card by referee Mark Halsey for a reckless lunge at Evans that left the United defender requiring treatment. Rodgers replaced Fabio Borini with Suso at the start of the second half and he was instantly involved as Liverpool claimed the lead they deserved. He showed confidence on the flanks and the move, which also included clever work from Johnson, ended with Gerrard sweeping a left-foot volley past Anders Lindegaard in front of an ecstatic Kop. United, who had brought Paul Scholes on for Nani to provide a measure of order to their midfield, were quickly level as Shinji Kagawa chested Valencia's cross into the path of Rafael, who curled a superb finish beyond the stretching Pepe Reina. Liverpool were still pressing forward and twice Lindegaard rescued United, saving low from Suarez then turning Suso's rising shot over the top. United had stabilised after that poor first half but it was still against the run of play when they went ahead from the spot - and Liverpool's undoing was all their own work. Daniel Agger and Johnson collided on the halfway line to concede possession, allowing Valencia to race forward. The run ended with Johnson upending the winger in a desperate attempt at recovery. To make matters worse for the home side, Agger was hurt in the clash was taken off on a stretcher before Van Persie finally converted the penalty, despite Reina getting a hand to his powerful effort which found the top corner. Liverpool had run out of steam, ending with nine men after Martin Kelly was injured, allowing United to close out an important win.

24.04.2013 23:34:15 Ashley Cole was the unlikely hero as Chelsea scored a dramatic late winner to breach Stoke's resistance. The England defender stole in with five minutes left to prod in Juan Mata's flick and keep Chelsea three points clear at the top of the Premier League. Stoke threatened to cause an upset when Jonathan Walters headed onto Cech's crossbar before half-time. Manager Tony Pulis threw Michael Owen on as he sensed victory, but it was Chelsea who snatched all three points. With Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich watching from the stands after his unscheduled visit to the training ground on Thursday, the onus was on Roberto Di Matteo to win - and win well. But against a side as disciplined and obdurate as Stoke that was never likely to be straightforward, despite their woeful record at Stamford Bridge. The Potters last league victory there had come in April 1974, but with Di Matteo opting to leave captain John Terry and Frank Lampard on the sidelines this was not a familiar, forceful Chelsea of the recent past. Rather than reinforce in the defensive midfield area after seeing Chelsea win the Champions League in May, Abramovich has invested in youth and attacking flair and almost all Â£80m of it was given its chance to shine against Stoke. And while there was no shortage of artistry or imagination from the attacking quartet of Fernando Torres, Eden Hazard, Juan Mata and Oscar but for all Chelsea's flicks and faints, Stoke were rarely stretched. For 85 minutes the champions of Europe were kept, in large part, at arm's length by Stoke, who arguably created the better chances. The home side had dominated the early exchanges with the quick feet of Hazard and the vision and craft of Mata to the fore. But Stoke, starved of possession, stood firm to create the two best chances of the opening 45 minutes. The first, perhaps predictably, came from a set-piece, as Walters rose above the Chelsea defence to head Glenn Whelan's right-wing delivery firmly against Cech's crossbar. Chelsea pushed and probed, but for all their flicks and flair, the lack of width in their attack allowed Stoke to remain organised and steadfast. Growing in confidence, Stoke surged forward again as half-time approached. Geoff Cameron drove over a right-wing cross which Michael Kightly headed goalwards, Cech saved the initial effort but Gary Cahill was required to clear off the line. The best of Chelsea's chances fell to Torres in the first half, as the Spanish striker chested down Mata's clever lobbed pass only to miss his kick from six yards with only Begovic to beat. Stoke struggled to contain Oscar too. The Brazilian, who was booked for a dive shortly after half-time, almost made amends soon after. He cut in, feinting and twitching to the edge of the box, slipped the ball on to his left foot but shot straight at Begovic. And yet the visitors remained a threat, sending on Owen, Kenwyne Jones and Matthew Etherington as they sniffed a chance of a historic upset. Walters prodded a half-chance narrowly wide of Cech's left-hand post, while Etherington's left-foot drive went flashing wide through a crowd of defenders. Chelsea kept pouring forward and, with time running out, eventually swept Stoke aside with a goal from an unlikely source. Lampard, on as a substitute, combined with Victor Moses and Mata on the edge of the box, with the Spaniard finally flicking the ball beyond the Stoke defence with his heel to allow Cole the chance to score the winner. It was the left-back's first Premier League goal since May 2010. The match ended on a sour note, however, with Chelsea defender David Luiz fortunate to escape a red card for a wreckless challenge on Walters. But although Di Matteo stressed the importance of the result, it is clear the new Chelsea remains a work in progress. Against Stoke they needed an old boy to bail them out.

24.04.2013 23:34:15 Southampton secured their first league victory of the season thanks to four second-half goals against Aston Villa. Villa, looking for a first away win since January, took the lead through a Darren Bent toe poke from two yards. Rickie Lambert levelled when he found the bottom corner and Nathaniel Clyne put Saints ahead by neatly finishing a fine Gaston Ramirez pass. Jason Puncheon's effort went in via defender Ciaran Clark and Lambert then added the fourth from the penalty spot. It was a stylish win and Southampton's first points of the campaign will give Nigel Adkins some breathing space after four Premier League matches without a victory had led to headlines linking former Liverpool boss Rafael Benitez with the Englishman's job. Adkins, though, insisted he and his team should be judged on their performance against Villa, rather than their opening matches against last season's top three sides, and the raucous cheers at full-time suggested the home fans were more than willing to give Adkins a stay of execution. Regardless of their manager's pre-match proclamations, Southampton's four defeats - during which they had conceded a record-equalling 14 goals - did seem to weigh heavily on his mind. The Southampton boss gave 20-year-old summer signing Paulo Gazzaniga his league debut in goal, with the Argentine replacing stalwart Kelvin Davis. Gazzaniga, a Â£2m purchase from Gillingham, could not have wished for an easier introduction as neither goalkeeper was called into action until Brad Guzan held onto an Adam Lallana overhead kick in the 30th minute. Last year's Championship runners-up were the superior side in the first half, with the triumvirate of Lallana, debutant Ramirez and Steven Davis combining well to out-pass their opponents in midfield and create a couple of half-chances for Lambert. But for all their creativity, lackadaisical defending once again proved to be Saints' downfall as Puncheon clumsily lost possession on the edge of the box for an error which led to Bent's first Premier League goal since February. Villa's record signing pounced to direct a Stephen Ireland miskick beyond a helpless Gazzaniga, ensuring the visitors went into the break ahead. Adkins introduced Frazer Richardson at half-time, while Villa boss Paul Lambert replaced Ireland with Ashley Westwood. The change seemed to initially pay dividends for Villa as Christian Benteke sent Bent free - only an excellent save from Gazzaniga prevented the striker from scoring a second. Benteke went agonisingly close with a header from the subsequent corner, but that was as good as it got for the visitors as Saints scored twice in five minutes. A beautiful first touch from Lambert helped the striker evade three defenders to squeeze the ball beyond Guzan for his third of the season, and shortly afterwards Clyne had the St Mary's faithful in full voice. A delightful pass from Â£12m signing Ramirez set the youngster free and the defender's cool finish would have impressed England Under-21s coach Stuart Pearce in the stands. Confidence was oozing through the home side as Ramirez caught the eye with wonderful passing and a third goal came in the 71st minute when Lambert put Puncheon through, his shot clipping Villa defender Clarke on the way into the net. Southampton concluded the match - and leaped off the bottom of the table - when impressive substitute Emmanuel Mayuka was felled by Guzan, allowing Lambert to score his second of the match and his 26th penalty for the club.

24.04.2013 23:34:15 Romelu Lukaku struck on his full debut as West Brom deservedly continued their excellent start to the season at the expense of struggling Reading. Lukaku collected Shane Long's knock down before beating Alex McCarthy from 18 yards with 14 minutes remaining. Jonas Olsson had earlier hit the post and McCarthy twice denied James Morrison as West Brom dominated. The result takes Steve Clarke's team up to third in the Premier League, while Reading have slipped to the bottom. Brian McDermott's Royals have only a solitary point from their first four games since returning to the top flight. In truth, there was not a huge amount between the two teams during what was a pretty mediocre match, but the Berkshire club have now conceded eight in their last three league fixtures and did not create many chances against the Baggies. Reading looked to wide men Jobi McAnuff and Garath McCleary as their prime attacking outlets but apart from one spectacular overhead kick from the latter in the early stages and a header that narrowly missed from substitute Hal Robson-Kanu late on, they struggled to break down the Baggies' backline. Adam Le Fondre buzzed around trying to influence the game but fellow forward Pavel Pogrebnyak was a peripheral figure and was withdrawn after 69 minutes. The Royals did have two penalty appeals, after surging runs from McAnuff were ended by Billy Jones, but referee Chris Foy denied them both. While there are plenty of problems for McDermott to tackle, Albion boss Clarke can take great satisfaction as his side quickly put behind last weekend's 3-0 defeat at Fulham behind them. Their 10 points from five games is the club's best start to a Premier League campaign, and they have conceded in only two of their last 10 games at The Hawthorns. Albion started both halves in lively fashion and McCarthy had to make an early low save to deny Morrison, who later in the opening half snatched at a shot after Zoltan Gera picked him out. The lively Lukaku, making his full league debut for the club, wasted a promising position shortly before the interval with a heavy touch that allowed Chris Gunter to make a covering tackle. From the subsequent corner Olsson almost scored but his powerful header hit the top of the post. The pattern continued after the break, with Reading keeper McCarthy making another excellent save to thwart a Morrison volley from long range, while Gera saw an effort blocked. Long came off the bench against his former club after 65 minutes and quickly played his part in the game's only goal. Lukaku's shot was hardly the most powerful effort on goal and was fairly central but McCarthy was unsighted as the ball passed through a team-mate's legs.  West Brom boss Steve Clarke: "Last week's 3-0 defeat at Fulham was our worst performance of the season but we have started well at home and we came into this game confident but respectful of Reading. "We just kept plugging away, it was always going to be a tight game. You could see halfway through that it might be a first goal wins it type of game and eventually we stuck one away. "After three home games it is pleasing to look at the stats but there is a long way to go. If we can keep our form at home it will be good for us this season."  Reading boss Brian McDermott: "We need to create more chances because if we do we will score goals. "We felt the game was drifting towards 0-0 and it was always going to be a case of one goal making the difference and they scored it. "We were better than we were against Spurs and we felt we should have got something but this league is unforgiving. "We have to move on quickly, which always do. We just need to stick together, which we have done for a long time. The players have been successful in the past and they will be again."

24.04.2013 23:34:15 Kevin Nolan dramatically rescued a draw for West Ham with an injury-time goal against Sunderland. In-form striker Steven Fletcher had put the visitors ahead when he angled home a powerful shot. West Ham piled on the pressure but were denied when Nolan's volley was impressively saved by Simon Mignolet. A header from Hammers defender James Collins struck the top of the crossbar before Modibo Maiga headed on to Nolan, who hooked in a shot. The draw leaves Sunderland without a win in 12 league games since March and while the manner of the draw will leave them frustrated and deflated, they will also be sick of the sight of Nolan. West Ham's skipper has scored six goals against them in the top flight, including a hat-trick for former club Newcastle in the Tyne-Wear derby against the Black Cats in October 2010. The home side deserved at least a point as they finally broke the resistance of a Sunderland side who spent most of the second period camped in their own half trying to resolutely defend the 11th minute lead given to them by Fletcher. There have been calls for the striker to resolve his differences with Scotland manager Craig Levein in order to regain his place in the national team. His finishing prowess, including an impressive goal which put Martin O'Neill's side ahead, added weight to the argument. Collins gave the ball away and winger Sebastian Larsson steered a cross to the far post, where Fletcher cushioned the ball to control with his first touch before driving in a left-foot shot past keeper Jussi Jaaskelainen. It was a fourth goal in three top-flight games for Fletcher this season and, shortly afterwards, he showed there was more to his game when he held the ball up and released James McClean. The Black Cats outnumbered the home defence but McClean's ambitious 25-yard strike went horribly wide. West Ham went close to an equaliser when Matt Taylor crossed for Ricardo Vaz Te, whose far-post header went just wide. The Hammers had been kept at bay by the visitors until they ended the first half in the ascendancy and Nolan twice went close. He acrobatically put a shot wide before meeting a Vaz Te cross with a sweetly struck volley. Mignolet flung himself to his left to palm the ball away for a smart save. Sunderland had not won away in the league since February and their goal was living a charmed life. But for all of West Ham's pressure, they were let down by some poor finishing. Hammers striker Carlton Cole climbed highest when he rose to meet a Mark Noble free-kick, but his mistimed effort went wide off the top of his head. Collins also had a good chance from a corner only to see his header graze the top of the crossbar. It seemed West Ham would be punished for their profligacy before their captain struck. Matt Jarvis did well to keep the ball in play and Maiga headed the ball on to midfielder Nolan, who swivelled and turned in a shot to preserve West Ham's unbeaten home league record this season, while Sunderland have now drawn all of their four top-flight games.  West Ham boss Sam Allardyce:  "In terms of play and chances we created enough to get back into the game. "We had pinned them back and were waiting for the quality of finish, which came in injury time. "Even in the dressing room the lads are disappointed we didn't win considering the attempts on goal we had."  Sunderland manager Martin O'Neill:  "We are frustrated with the late equaliser in terms of the way it was conceded and the timing. "We defended manfully but I thought we could have won. We had some good chances on the break. "Overall, it was a tough game. We knew it would be and so it proved."

24.04.2013 23:34:15 Hugo Rodallega scored against his old club to help Fulham to a well-deserved victory at Wigan. The 27-year-old Colombian headed in his first goal for the London side from strike partner Dimitar Berbatov's superb cross on the half-hour mark. Damien Duff doubled Fulham's lead with a fierce strike on 68 minutes. Arouna Kone managed to pull one back for Wigan late on as he slid the ball home but Fulham held firm to secure their first away points of the season. In stark contrast to last season, in which Martin Jol failed to win any of their opening six games, Fulham have now won nine points from their first five games. Their first league win on the road was fully deserved, with summer signings Berbatov and Rodallega validating Jol's decision to pick them ahead of Mladen Petric and Bryan Ruiz, who had both recovered from injury. The game started tamely, with the only exciting moment coming when referee Lee Probert was robustly upended by both Fulham's Steve Sidwell and Wigan's Ben Watson as he got in the way of the two opposing players as they battled for the loose ball. The incident seemed to spark the game into life, with Rodallega meeting Berbatov's cross only to be denied by an alert Wigan goalkeeper Ali Al Habsi. Rodallega, who left Wigan in the summer when his contract ran out, showed again what they might be missing as he teed up Berbatov for an effort that Al Habsi pushed wide. Wigan were struggling to cope with the pair and it came as no surprise when they combined again to put the visitors in front. This time Rodallega headed past Al Habsi before respectfully apologising to the Wigan faithful for scoring against them. Wigan had only mustered four goals so far this season before this game and with the man who scored two of them, Franco Di Santo, out with a calf injury they were struggling to find a cutting edge. But the man who took his place in the team, Jordi Gomez, did go close before the break when he struck the underside of the bar with a powerful effort. The second period began in similar quiet fashion before Kone squandered a chance after being put clean through by Shaun Maloney. With the goal at his mercy, Wigan's summer signing fired straight at Fulham goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer. Substitute Ruiz troubled Al Habsi with a free-kick before teeing up Duff for the second. Costa Rican Ruiz beat off four men to poke the ball across the area to the Irishman who struck past Al Habsi. Fulham were moments away from a clean sheet until substitute Callum McManaman's shot pinged around the area before falling to the feet of Kone who slid the ball home, but for Wigan it was a case of too little, too late.  Wigan manager Roberto Martinez:  "It was a really open game with a lot of chances - something we can't be happy about. When you get so many, whoever is going to take them is going to win. We had our chances and we didn't take them. "We want to win games at home and to do that you need more defensive intensity. Overall we need to be better. "Now it is time to open the competition, I think the competition is now open for places."  Fulham manager Martin Jol:  "It is nice to get three points on the board. They are a difficult team. It was pleasing to see us taking the initiative. "We needed that [second] goal as they scored in added time. You can't complain because they are a good football team, they deserved a goal too. "One of the reasons that I played him [Rodallega] was because it was against his former team and he had extra motivation to score against his old club."

24.04.2013 23:34:15 Everton ended Swansea City's unbeaten home record with a dominant display of power and precision in south Wales. Victor Anichebe gave Everton a controversial opener when he volleyed home after a suspicion of handball from Marouane Fellaini in the build-up. Kevin Mirallas finished a sweeping move on the second attempt to double the lead in a one-sided first half. Swansea defender Angel Rangel missed an open goal before Fellaini headed a third after Nathan Dyer's red card. Dyer, a second-half substitute for Swansea's record signing Pablo Hernandez - who struggled on his full debut - lasted only 13 minutes after picking up a pair of yellow cards within a minute of each other. By then Everton were in full control and the home side were fortunate not to have conceded more than one goal in the second half. The visitors were sharper, hungrier and slicker from the first whistle as they maintained their proud record of never having lost to Swansea. But for all their superiority, they were exposed at the back on a number of occasions and were thankful to fine saves by Tim Howard and a horrendous miss by Rangel. Swansea were fortunate to survive a lethargic start as Michel Vorm saved first from Anichebe and then twice from Mirallas in the opening three minutes. The warning signs were not heeded, however, and Anichebe's opener on 21 minutes had more than a hint of inevitability. Fellaini caused the damage, controlling a long-ball into the Swansea area before poking the ball towards Anichebe, whose volley from six yards left Vorm hopeless. That gave Anichebe, replacing the injured Nikica Jelavic, his first back-to-back Premier League goals in his career. There could be no doubting the merits of the goal, but the telling touch from Fellaini seemed to come off his arm. Swansea's slumber lasted until 10 minutes before the break when they finally threatened as Miguel Michu headed over and Ki Sung Yueng, making his full debut, curled a 25-yard effort narrowly wide. But Everton quickly re-asserted their authority as Mirallas doubled the lead with a classic counter-attack. Phil Neville began the move deep in his own half, before Fellaini released Steven Pienaar down the right flank. Pienaar's cross was perfectly weighted for the unmarked Mirallas, who nodded home after his initial shot was tipped onto the underside of the bar by the overworked Vorm. For all of Everton's almost effortless dominance, Swansea could easily have gone into the break level. Right-back Rangel was the unlikely source of the attacking threat as he was first denied by Tim Howard's leg and then somehow missed from two yards at the far post. Michael Laudrup's response was to replace Hernandez, but Dyer's sending off encapsulated a day where nothing went right for the Swans. The first card was for dissent and the winger was still clearly rattled as he flew into a wild challenge on Leighton Baines that almost warranted a red card in itself. Moments earlier, the bar saved Swansea from a third as Mirallas - whose earlier goal was Everton's 7000th in league games - drilled a shot from inside the area. Anichebe proved a constant thorn in Swansea's side, and more of his fine work was wasted when Fellaini blazed over from seven yards straight in front of Vorm. A third seemed only a matter of time, and Fellaini made amends for his earlier miss eight minutes from time with a deflected header from Baines's cross. Still there was time for Swansea to press for a consolation goal, and Jonathan de Guzman nearly obliged but his free-kick rattled Howard's crossbar.  Swansea manager Michael Laudrup:  "I have to say Everton deserved the win, they were better than us. "We were disappointing in the first 30 minutes and we gave away a lot of fouls, they had five or six free-kicks in the first 10 minutes and we played too slow and the first 30 minutes laid the ground work for the defeat. "We can learn from this. We were 2-0 down and had a good reaction, but the first 30 minutes was very disappointing, the worst we have been this season until now. "The second yellow was a little unlucky, Nathan went to kick the ball, he missed the ball and in the same movement kicked his opponent but it was a yellow card and you can't say anything about it."  Everton manager David Moyes:  "We could have scored probably six or seven goals. But they had probably three or four good opportunities. "The performance was fabulous, it really was. The players are playing really well, they're playing with a lot of confidence and self-belief. "We felt we should have probably won on Monday night, and if we had done, we might have been in a better position than we are today. "We have finished a lot of seasons strongly and the one year we got off to a good start we qualified for the Champions League and we have to do that if we can."

24.04.2013 23:34:15 Everton were left feeling robbed of victory after Demba Ba's last-minute equaliser gave Newcastle United a point at Goodison Park. Ba levelled after substitute Victor Anichebe looked to have given Everton victory two minutes from time - after earlier having a header ruled out despite the ball appearing to cross the line. In a thrilling encounter, Everton dominated the first half and led deservedly through Leighton Baines's early strike until Ba's introduction after the interval transformed Newcastle's attacking threat. He was on target within four minutes but Goodison Park was infuriated when Anichebe's header dropped behind the line after being parried by Newcastle keeper Steve Harper 12 minutes from time, only for referee Mike Jones to wave play on after looking to his assistant. Everton also felt aggrieved when an earlier goal from Marouane Fellaini was disallowed for offside. Anichebe, however, looked to have given Everton the win they felt they deserved but Newcastle's improved second half performance brought them a draw as Ba rolled in his second in the closing moments. It will once again ignite the debate about goal-line technology - but it will be of no consolation to Everton or manager David Moyes as they were left frustrated. The evening started in moving fashion as Everton paid an emotional tribute to the Hillsborough families before kick-off, after last week's revelations, as warm applause rang around Goodison Park while The Hollies' hit "He Ain't Heavy He's My Brother" was played. At the same time the names of those who died in the 1989 tragedy were displayed on the big screens. When the action got under way Everton thought they had taken the lead in the opening moments when Nikica Jelavic turned in after Fellaini's shot had been parried by Harper. The effort was ruled out for offside and Jelavic's pain was increased as he injured his knee colliding with a post. It was the start of a bruising evening for the Croatian striker which ended with him limping off just before half-time. Everton's impressive start to the season was mirrored in their fluency early in the game, illustrated by a superb opening goal from Baines. The England defender took Steven Pienaar's clever flick in his stride before drilling a low shot under Harper. As Everton dominated, the lively Kevin Mirallas illuminated his home debut with a shot narrowly off target while Phil Jagielka glanced the post from 25 yards after Jelavic's delicate lay-off. Newcastle, even though they spent most of the half in retreat, also had opportunities of their own. Papiss Cisse should have done better than volley wide from Phil Neville's poor header and Baines was forced to scramble off the line from team-mate Leon Osman. Pardew - watching from the stands as he served the first of a two-game ban for shoving assistant referee Peter Kirkup on the opening day of the season - introduced Ba at the start of the second half and within four minutes he had equalised. Osman lost possession cheaply, allowing Yohan Cabaye to find Ba for a low left-foot finish past Everton keeper Tim Howard. Everton thought they had regained the lead when Fellaini converted from Pienaar's pass but once again the offside flag chalked off the goal, with replays suggesting it was the most marginal of decisions. Pienaar was the creator of Everton's best moments and he fashioned an opening for Osman with 15 minutes left but his sidefoot finish was wide. The night's most contentious moment came with 12 minutes left when Anichebe's header crossed the line before Mike Williamson scrambled it away and play was waved on - much to Goodison Park's disgust. Hatem Ben Arfa then had the opportunity to increase Everton's sense of injustice but Howard made a crucial block as he accelerated away from Jagielka. Everton thought they had put the perceived wrong right as Anichebe turned on Pienaar's pass to shoot low past Harper, but Ba had the last word at the end of a hugely entertaining game.  Newcastle boss Alan Pardew:  "I was proud of the second half because we were terrific, but in the first half we lacked belief and I was shocked at how we played. "At half-time I put some belief in the team, sometimes that's all you need. "In the first half we were as bad as we've ever been since I've been in charge. "I'll never set up a team to get a point and in the first half we looked as if we did, thankfully that changed in the second half and we got the point."

24.04.2013 23:34:15 Tottenham produced a stunning fightback against Manchester City to boost their Champions League ambitions and leave Manchester United three points away from winning the Premier League title. City led through Samir Nasri's early strike before Spurs hit back with three goals in seven second-half minutes. Clint Dempsey's tap-in levelled before Jermain Defoe fired past Joe Hart. Gareth Bale, returning from injury, dinked a third as Spurs moved to within a point of fourth-placed Chelsea. Bale's goal capped a dramatic turnaround in north London and means United will clinch their 20th top-flight crown by beating Aston Villa at Old Trafford on Monday.  Roberto Mancini's defending champions are 13 points adrift of their cross-city rivals with five games left to play for both sides. Yet for the majority of the match it seemed as though City would clinch a routine win and keep their slim hopes of retaining the title alive after Nasri steered in James Milner's pullback. Tottenham went into the match on the back of a 10-day break following their Europa League exit at Basel but they produced a lethargic display until bursting into life after Dempsey's equaliser. Up to that point, City's assurance in possession, coupled with their willingness to drive forward on the counter-attack, served to frustrate the majority inside a subdued White Hart Lane. The visitors spurned several chances to double their lead as Nasri poked wide from Carlos Tevez's ingenious flick and Spurs keeper Hugo Lloris stopped the Argentine striker's header with an instinctive one-handed save. But Dempsey, clearly on-side despite the protest of the City defence, pounced at the far post to convert Bale's outside-of-the-boot cross and punish their profligacy. Suddenly, the home crowd found their voices and the players found their belief as they upped the tempo in search of the lead. It came four minutes later when substitute Defoe, who had only just entered the action as a replacement for the ineffective Emmanuel Adebayor, cut inside City skipper Vincent Kompany before unleashing a unstoppable angled drive past Hart. Spurs looked a completely different team as their energy levels rose, in contrast to a City team who started to look like they were feeling the effects, both mentally and physically, of a hectic week. The Blues enjoyed the high of reaching the FA Cup final by beating last-four opponents Chelsea at Wembley on Sunday, before grinding out a 1-0 Premier League win against Wigan on Wednesday. Spurs talisman Bale, who has missed two games with ankle ligament damage, was almost anonymous in the opening 75 minutes before he followed up his assist for the equaliser by scoring the third. The Welshman latched on to a piercing throughball from another Spurs substitute, Tom Huddlestone, and managed to hold off Gael Clichy to coolly clip over the head of Hart. Victory leaves fifth-placed Tottenham one point adrift of Chelsea, who currently occupy the final Champions League qualification place, and two points behind third-placed Arsenal. But Spurs have a game in hand on the Gunners, meaning a place in Europe's premier club competition remains in their hands as they enter the final month of the season.  Tottenham manager Andre Villas-Boas:  "It was a great game and the players did ever so well to come back into it. In the first half we didn't play with confidence, but we always had the desire to come back into the game. "In the second half everything changed and we played with more confidence. We found more spaces and we found the back of the net, deservedly. "Gareth [Bale] gave us the green light - he was fully prepared. Physically he's a monster and played 90 minutes, a great, great performance. Credit to him."

24.04.2013 23:34:15 Tomas Rosicky scored in each half as 10-man Arsenal withstood a West Brom fightback to move above Chelsea into fourth place in the Premier League. Rosicky cleared a Claudio Yacob effort off the line before putting Arsenal ahead with a powerful diving header. The Czech midfielder struck again after half-time, drilling into the bottom corner at the second attempt. James Morrison converted a penalty as Per Mertesacker was sent off for a foul on Shane Long, but Arsenal held firm. They go a point clear of Chelsea in the final Champions League spot, but have played a game more than the Stamford Bridge club. The Gunners have won six of their last seven league games and are one point behind Tottenham - who play Everton on Sunday, with Chelsea at home to Sunderland.  West Brom remain eighth, which would be their highest Premier League finish, but they have only won once in their last five top-flight games. Arsenal were back at The Hawthorns for the first time since winning on the final day of last season to secure Champions League qualification. They returned in the midst of another battle to reach Europe's elite club competition. That perhaps contributed to a edgy start, in which Rosicky was forced to clear a Yacob header off the line. But if his intervention was vital in defence, it was equally telling in attack. Gervinho collected Mikel Arteta's long ball forward, befuddling Gareth McAuley, before producing a strike that was intercepted by Rosicky with a thumping near-post header. The breakthrough appeared to settle Arsenal's nerves and Ben Foster saved well with his legs to deny Gervinho, while Aaron Ramsey prodded wide when he should have found the net. West Brom offered little in attack, though they had strong claims for a penalty when Laurent Koscielny brought down Yacob. With the Baggies yet to come from behind at half-time to win a game this season, and Arsenal in possession of the division's best second-half record, a turnaround seemed unlikely. The odds lengthened when Rosicky doubled his side's advantage, beating Foster at the second attempt having been set up by Ramsey. Steve Clarke responded by introducing Romelu Lukaku and Markus Rosenberg, and immediately West Brom carried a greater threat. Top scorer Lukaku tested Lukasz Fabianski with a deflected free-kick, before the Polish goalkeeper denied Chris Brunt from a tight angle. Long then met a perfectly weighted pass over the top, drawing a clumsy foul from Mertesacker that earned the German a straight red card. Morrison drilled his spot-kick through the legs of Fabianski to haul his side back into contention with half an hour remaining. As West Brom pressed hard for an equaliser, Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger sent on defensive reinforcements in the form of Thomas Vermaelen, Kieran Gibbs and Francis Coquelin. McAuley headed off target, Lukaku curled a glorious chance wide and Long lashed over the bar when well placed. Arsenal's celebrations at full-time showed how much the result meant.  West Brom manager Steve Clarke:  "I thought we played well today. They scored in the first half with one of the very few chances they created. We had good control in the first half but didn't really create enough. "We could have had a penalty for a challenge on Claudio Yacob on the edge of the box [by Laurent Koscielny]. On another day that was a penalty and would have changed the complexion of the afternoon. "We were disappointed to lose the second goal at the start of the second half. It was crucial for us to get back in it and we gave away another soft goal, a bad goal to lose. "At 2-0 it is difficult to chase the game. We made a couple of changes. Then the penalty and the red card does change the game and gives us the chance to get something from the game."  Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger:  "We know we have one target - to win our games. Then we don't have to look at Tottenham or Chelsea. "If we lose our games, then you have to look at the results of the others. Our attitude is simple, we have to win the games. "Can we finish fourth? I believe we will do it. We are conscious as well we have to give 100 per cent commitment in every game and it will be difficult and edgy to the end. "We are ready for the fight and we always tell the players 'don't look at everyone else, just focus on ourselves'."

24.04.2013 23:34:15 Andre Villas-Boas secured his first victory as Tottenham manager as Premier League newcomers Reading were outclassed at the Madejski Stadium. The Portuguese has already faced questions about his future after only three games in charge - but this powerful performance and convincing win provided an emphatic response. Jermain Defoe gave Spurs an early lead and such was the scale of their domination that Villas-Boas might have been frustrated it took until the 71st minute for Gareth Bale to double their advantage. Defoe then concluded a 50-yard run with a powerful angled finish as Reading - overrun throughout - faded badly, even though Hal Robson-Kanu pulled a goal back in stoppage time. It was a display that will have given Villas-Boas great heart, with Mousa Dembele and Sandro providing power and fluidity in midfield alongside another newcomer, former Reading man Gylfi Sigurdsson. And in Defoe they have a poacher in prime form, aided by the pace and width of Bale and Aaron Lennon. For Reading, understandably rusty after 25 days without a game, this was a chastening lesson in what will be required to survive in the top tier, although they met a Spurs team in no mood for anything other than victory after their indifferent start to the season. Villas-Boas made good on his promise to keep faith with keeper Brad Friedel in preference to new signing Hugo Lloris - but the decision was an irrelevance throughout a first half totally controlled by the visitors. In contrast, Reading keeper Alex McCarthy, in for the injured Adam Federici, was swiftly employed as he made a smart save from Sigurdsson's header and Jan Vertonghen's powerful follow-up. Spurs were a constant threat and it was no surprise when they took the lead after 18 minutes. Sigurdsson's precise pass opened up space for Lennon to cross and Defoe to finish with typical efficiency. The hosts looked overawed and elementary errors did not help their cause. Defoe stole the ball off keeper McCarthy as he dawdled in the area and it needed a rescuing block on the line from Alex Pearce to stop Sigurdsson adding a second. Then Ian Harte, who had struggled to contain the pace of Lennon, carelessly presented possession to Defoe but Spurs were unable to benefit and the Royals escaped again. Reading adopted a more attacking approach at the start of the second half with Adam Le Fondre on for Jem Karacan - but it was still the London side creating the opportunities. Defoe held his head in anguish as a shot from Dembele struck him in the six-yard area but somehow landed the wrong side of the post with McCarthy wrong-footed. A second goal looked inevitable and finally came 19 minutes from time when Kyle Walker broke into the area and pulled the ball back for Bale, whose half-hit finish deceived McCarthy. And with the home side's spirit broken, the third goal followed quickly, Defoe breaking from the halfway line to outpace the defence and send a crisp finish into the far corner to put gloss on a fine Spurs performance that even the concession of Robson-Kanu's goal could not tarnish.  Reading manager Brian McDermott:  "I thought we were too submissive and didn't get on the ball enough or in their faces. I made some changes and we were much better in the second half. "We came up against a very good side today and they deserved the win. "We've got to move on very, very quickly. Today was a learning curve for all of us. Spurs is a team full of world-class performers, but we didn't cause enough problems for them, especially in the first half. "We should have had a penalty in the first half when it was 0-0, and we scored a goal at the end. We can also draw positives from 20 minutes in the second half. "We have a fantastic bunch of people working here and I know what I will get out of them next Saturday."  Spurs manager Andre Villas-Boas:  "I'm extremely happy for [Defoe]. He is such a prolific striker for club and country. It's amazing how he sniffs out goal-scoring opportunities and makes the most of them. "I know there were questions being raised about him being played up front on his own. On his own or with Emmanuel Adebayor alongside him, I think Jermain can continue to produce these kind of attacking opportunities. "I'm extremely happy with the performance. The players showed tremendous commitment, responsibility and concentration. They understood that we have been working so hard and they deserved to get this first win." On perceived criticism from predecessor Harry Redknapp in a Saturday newspaper interview: "In the end it's not about the manager, it's about the players. Different kinds of managers have different leadership styles and the way they go about his business."

24.04.2013 23:34:16 An emotional week for Liverpool following the Hillsborough revelations ended in a draw at Sunderland. Reds striker Fabio Borini had two early shots saved before Steven Fletcher tapped in for Sunderland after Craig Gardner's mazy run and cross. Liverpool came close to a goal when Glen Johnson's shot hit the crossbar and Steven Gerrard fired just wide. The equaliser eventually came when Luis Suarez sidefooted in after his initial effort came back off Titus Bramble. Jonjo Shelvey had a late chance for the visitors as they finished the match the stronger but his shot was saved by keeper Simon Mignolet. The build-up to the match had been dominated by the Hillsborough findings and there was a show of solidarity between the two clubs at the ground, Sunderland flying flags at the Stadium of Light at half-mast as a mark of respect. Once the match got under way, the Black Cats initially highlighted a lack of creativity and cutting edge from the Reds. The home side allowed their guests plenty of possession and tried to catch them out on the break as they put up a disciplined defensive barrier. The strategy almost had to be abandoned early on when defender Carlos Cuellar's tame header back to Mignolet let in Borini, whose shot was blocked by the Black Cats keeper. Borini had another opening when Suarez touched the ball into his path only for the Italian's first-time shot to be parried away by the alert Mignolet. But, in the main, Sunderland kept Liverpool comfortably at arm's length and they reaped the rewards when they took the lead with their first real attack. Gardner weaved past Suarez and Johnson before sliding a low cross for Fletcher to slot in on his home Premier League debut. To add to Liverpool's growing frustrations, Suarez was booked for diving when he went over John O'Shea's leg. The Reds regrouped after the break and Johnson, playing at left-back, cut inside before curling in a shot that came back off the crossbar. Sunderland survived another scare when Raheem Sterling's cross caused confusion in their area, ending with Gerrard's guided shot hitting the outside of the post. Teenager Sterling was Liverpool's main threat and it was another of his crosses from the right that led to the equaliser. Suarez failed to connect properly with his first attempt and, after the ball ricocheted back to him off Bramble, he steered in a shot with his left foot. Shelvey's failure to take his late chance left both camps with a point and still without a Premier League win so far this season.  Sunderland boss Martin O'Neill:  "I thought we played well in the first half, we gave as good as we got, got the goal in front. "The irony of it is that we were probably in the second half having our best spell in possession of the ball and looked as if we had got a second wind when they got the equalising goal. "But they had a number of chances and didn't take them, hit the bar and so from that viewpoint, probably a point was a fair result."  Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers:  "The players have been terrific. It's been a difficult week, of course, as you can imagine for the city and everything surrounding it. "The performance was outstanding, both our creativity and our movement, and there was a really good tempo and rhythm to our game. "We went behind and we were disappointed with the goal, it was a soft goal from our perspective and it went in against the run of play. "But in the second half, we showed a real reaction and continued what we were doing in the first half, but really upped the tempo and the penetration in our game and by the end of it, I am sure Sunderland were probably happier with the point than ourselves."

24.04.2013 23:34:16 Arsenal produced a superb first-half display of attacking football to sweep bottom-of-the-table Southampton aside. A Jos Hooiveld own goal opened the scoring before Lukas Podolski arrowed a 25-yard free-kick into the top corner. Gervinho then drilled in, and Nathaniel Clyne buried a second own goal before Danny Fox pulled one back. Gervinho grabbed his second after the break and substitute Theo Walcott then added a late sixth to leave Southampton still looking for their first point. With games against both Manchester clubs and a trip to Emirates Stadium in their first four games, life back in the top flight was always going to get off to a tough start for Nigel Adkins' side. The Saints scared Manchester United before the international break, but were simply blown away in an opening 40 minutes here as Arsenal ran riot. Many of the headlines emanating from the Emirates this summer concentrated on the loss of skipper Robin van Persie and Alex Song, but in Lukas Podolski and Santi Cazorla, manager Arsene Wenger has signed two players of genuine quality. Those two in particular were behind a glittering first-half display, with Southampton simply unable to cope at times with the movement and passing in the final third. Podolski began the game operating from the left but was continually on the move, swapping positions with Cazorla and Gervinho in a fluid front three. Left-back Kieran Gibbs was also a major attacking threat as the visitors' defence was stretched to breaking point. Podolski and Cazorla had already gone close before Podolski retrieved a lost cause in midfield and played in the impressive Gibbs overlapping on the left. The defender's low cross-shot squirmed through the legs of Kelvin Davis and rebounded into the net off the shins of Hooiveld. Podolski's goalscoring record in the Bundesliga was not always overly impressive, but his haul of 44 international goals suggested he would be a potent threat in the Premier League and he doubled the lead with a brilliant free-kick from 25 yards, giving Davis no chance. Hooiveld went off with a calf injury before the half-hour mark as Adkins attempted to plug the holes in his defence, only for replacement Maya Yoshida to be culpable for the third goal. Mikel Arteta lifted a pass over the Japanese defender, who was caught horribly out of position as Gervinho sprinted clear to thump a shot past Davis at his near post. Cazorla, Podolski and Gibbs then carved open the Saints with another neat passing triangle down the left and when Gibbs flashed a cross towards goal, Clyne could only turn the ball past Davis and into the net. Fox looked as surprised as everyone else when he pulled one back for the visitors on the stroke of half-time - the first goal conceded by Arsenal in the league this season. Wojciech Szczesny was at fault as he collided with Carl Jenkinson to leave Fox with a tap-in. The home side were not at the same level after the break as Southampton's record signing Gaston Ramirez began to show a few glimpses of his ability. But it was an Arsenal replacement who gave the game some impetus again, Aaron Ramsey showing great skill to flick the ball past Clyne and see a low shot hit the post, Gervinho tucking away the rebound with ease. And the rout was concluded late on when Thomas Vermaelen saw his powerful shot pushed away by Davis, but Saints old boy Walcott steered home the rebound left-footed.  Southampton manager Nigel Adkins:  "Arsenal were very good. At times they were exhilarating as they have been many times here, it was a lesson for our players. "If you give quality players time they will hurt you and that's what happened. We turned it over far too cheaply. "We knew these first four games would be tough, we haven't got any points but we will get ready for next week and now we have to start getting points on the board. This is a ruthless division."

24.04.2013 23:34:16 Matthew Lowton's swerving shot and a Christian Benteke debut strike gave Aston Villa their first league win of the season and Swansea a first defeat. Lowton's spectacular strike, his first for Villa, took a slight deflection but may still have flown past Michel Vorm. Ashley Williams and Nathan Dyer had good early chances for Swansea but the visitors' goal threat was sporadic. Instead it was Villa's big summer recruit Benteke who sealed the win, punishing Williams's defensive blunder. Defensively, Villa showed themselves eager to upset Swansea's smooth passing style, while in attack the home side also showed their intent, full-back Eric Lichaj catching the eye with his forays down the left flank. But it was to Brad Guzan that Villa were initially indebted as the goalkeeper, again preferred to Shay Given, pulled off a fine double save. First the American showed good reactions to beat out Williams's header from a corner, then launched himself to palm away a Nathan Dyer shot after the winger gathered the loose ball. Villa continued to probe and Brett Holman did well to intercept a stray pass and gallop into space on the right. His cross was destined for Darren Bent but Leon Britton had spotted the danger and tracked back to make a timely intervention. Swansea's defence had an unfamiliar look, manager Michael Laudrup having been forced to change two of his back four because of Neil Taylor's broken ankle and Chico Flores's suspension. Teenager Ben Davies continued to show he is an able deputy for left-back Taylor, while Alan Tate returned at centre-back more than a year after breaking his leg in a golf buggy accident. Tate's joy at his return was short-lived however as defender Lowton, a Â£3m summer buy from Sheffield United, let fly with a speculative shot from 20 yards. The ball just skimmed Tate's head but that was enough to help cause a wild deviation in its flight, completely wrong-footing Vorm in the Swansea goal. The goal was the perfect cue for a minute's applause by the home fans to show support for midfielder Stiliyan Petrov - currently in remission from leukaemia - timed for the 19th minute to honour the Bulgarian's shirt number. Swansea almost claimed an equaliser before the break when Angel Rangel's sublime pass sent Dyer free down the right. The winger cut the ball across for Danny Graham but the striker was just unable to connect with the inviting cross. Villa cranked up the pressure on the visitors after half-time and forced four corners in quick succession, the last causing a scramble in the penalty area. Andreas Weimann picked up the ball with his back to goal but swivelled to shoot off his right foot, only to be denied by the slight frame of Britton on guard at the far post. Laudrup introduced record Swansea signing Pablo Hernandez for his debut in place of Wayne Routledge, but it did little to undo Villa's stranglehold on the game. Tate needed to stretch every neck muscle to cut out a cross meant for Weimann as he surged into the Swansea box. That was the Austrian's last action as Villa boss Paul Lambert sent on Â£7m deadline-day signing Benteke while another new recruit, Ashley Westwood, also made his debut in place of Stephen Ireland. Benteke was soon in action, the Belgium international seeing his shot deflected wide, while Vorm had to be on his toes to tip Ciaran Clark's header over the bar. The Dutch international again came to Swansea's rescue when Benteke's lay-off allowed Karim El Ahmadi to let fly. Benteke should have opened his Villa account, and made the win safe, when he completely missed Bent's intelligent knock-back - but he swiftly made amends. The Belgian was lurking to pounce when Williams sent a weak header back towards his keeper and Benteke chipped the ball over Vorm. Swansea replacement Luke Moore, on for Graham, had two good chances to give the visitors late hope but Villa saw out a much-needed first win.  Villa manager Paul Lambert:  "I thought Christian was unplayable, he was an absolute threat. "The great thing is he's only 21, only a kid and still learning. "He had a really good game for the national team, if you're holding your own in that company you're doing alright. "Everything is a culture shock for him at the minute but he was excellent. "The goal will give him confidence. The crowd will go with him. You heard the crowd's reaction when he came on."  Swansea boss Michael Laudrup:  "When things are going well you want the run to continue. "But we had an international break. You never know how the players will be when they get back."

24.04.2013 23:34:16 Dimitar Berbatov scored twice in a dream home debut as Fulham ended 10-man West Bromwich Albion's unbeaten start to the new Premier League season. The Bulgarian striker superbly stroked Martin Jol's men ahead, before doubling their advantage from the penalty spot in first-half injury time. Albion's Peter Odemwingie was sent off between Berbatov's strikes after kicking out at Fulham's Sascha Riether. The hosts wrapped up a comfortable win with Steve Sidwell's late tap-in. Berbatov was described as the "biggest signing in Fulham's history" by boss Martin Jol following his deadline-day move from Manchester United and the 31-year-old, who can often frustrate supporters with the languid manner in which he plays, went some way to justifying his manager's bold declaration with an energetic performance. He was the focal point for much of Fulham's attacking play, aiming to use his deft touch to bring his team-mates into play and pull apart an Albion defence which had conceded just once in their first three Premier League games. However, it was the trickery of Swedish winger Alex Kacaniklic which created the openings from which Berbatov profited. Kacaniklic danced into the left side of Albion's penalty area, leaving behind dazed right-back Billy Jones, before playing a square pass to Berbatov, who took one touch before arrowing a delightful 15-yard shot beyond away goalkeeper Ben Foster for the opener. Jones was left in a spin again shortly before half-time when he could only stop Kacaniklic's teasing run into the box with a trailing leg and Berbatov stepped up to coolly send Foster the wrong way from the penalty spot. While Berbatov was undoubtedly the hero for the hosts, Albion winger Odemwingie could be cast as the away side's villain after his needless 37th-minute sending off. The Nigerian forward, who had been promoted to the Baggies' starting XI following an impressive substitute appearance in their 2-0 win over Everton, lost possession before wildly swiping at Fulham right-back Riether from behind. Referee Roger East had no option other than to show the red card and it left Albion facing an uphill task as they looked to extend their best start to a Premier League season to a fourth match without defeat. Albion boss Steve Clarke introduced Chris Brunt and Romelu Lukaku at the interval in the hope of finding a way back into the match. Belgian striker Lukaku was denied by Fulham keeper Mark Schwarzer as Albion battled gamely, but Fulham took advantage as the tiring West Brom defence began to creak. Foster showed superb reactions to twice deny Damien Duff in a matter of seconds, before the ex-England international prevented Berbatov bagging his hat-trick by smothering his shot from a tight angle. But he was powerless to stop Sidwell adding the third, pouncing after Hugo Rodallega's header hit the crossbar, to leave Albion without a win at Craven Cottage since October 1967.  Fulham striker Dimitar Berbatov:  "It was a great home debut. I had a feeling before the game that it would be a good day for the team and me. And it's a great feeling. I feel satisfied with the result and my play, and all the supporters are happy as well. "It was my first performance at home and I felt good because I was on the pitch playing. When I'm happy great things happen, like today. I scored and played with a smile on my face. Most important for me is playing every game and when I can do that I give my best performances."

24.04.2013 23:34:16 Paul Scholes celebrated another landmark in his glittering career by scoring the opening goal as Manchester United coasted to a resounding victory over Wigan at Old Trafford. The 37-year-old, making his 700th appearance for United, tapped in from close range six minutes into the second half to inspire a victory that lifts his side in to second place in the Premier League table, a point behind leaders Chelsea. United recovered from seeing Javier Hernandez have a controversial fifth-minute penalty saved by Wigan goalkeeper Ali Al-Habsi by striking three times in 15 second-half minutes to decide the contest. Hernandez turned in debutant Alex Buttner's low cross to make it two, before the Dutchman himself beat Al-Habsi too easily from a narrow angle. Substitute Nick Powell, also making his debut, completed the rout with a thunderous 20-yard shot. The one negative note for the home side was some unsavoury chanting from a minority of their fans aimed at Liverpool supporters in the wake of revelations about the Hillsborough tragedy.  After the match a Manchester United spokesman said: "The manager has made the club's position very clear on this matter, it's now up to the fans to respect that." For long periods United were well below their best, especially during a first half which Wigan finished the more convincingly. But as the visitors' exhaustive pressing game began to run out of steam, Sir Alex Ferguson's side moved through the gears and then had the luxury of giving Robin van Persie a 20 minute run-out ahead of Wednesday's Champions League match against Galatasaray. Scholes was at the heart of United's revival, pulling the strings with his laser-guided passing and well-oiled repertoire of feints and flicks. There was more than one reminder that his tackling remains more than a little wild, but as he trudged off to a standing ovation 20 minutes from time, it was his goal that United fans preferred to remember. The result aside, this was a landmark day for United. Scholes was making his 700th appearance in a United shirt and Rio Ferdinand his 400th, while Ryan Giggs took to the field for his 600th Premier League match. It was also Ferguson's 500th home league match - he had won 355 of the previous 499 (drawing 95 and losing 49). None of it made pretty reading for Wigan, who had lost all seven of their Premier League matches at Old Trafford, conceding 24 goals and with just a lone stoppage-time penalty in 2006 to show for their efforts. And yet somehow there was hope. Ferguson admitted in his pre-match programme notes that defeat by "little Wigan" had ultimately cost United the title last season. And until Scholes broke the deadlock five minutes into the second half, "little Wigan" were threatening to do it all over again, as they tackled, battled, and denied their more celebrated opponents space. United might have been ahead as early as the fifth minute, when Al-Habsi was controversially adjudged to have made contact with Danny Welbeck in the penalty area, but the Wigan goalkeeper went to down to his left to deny Hernandez from the resulting penalty. It was Welbeck who had the best of United's chances during a fragmented and frustrating first half, with the England striker creating and spurning a series of opportunities. Wigan ended the first period on the front foot, with Ivan Ramis and, in particular, Arouna Kone spurning good chances. And yet all that was forgotten within five minutes of the restart, when Michael Carrick spun on the edge of the penalty area and freed Nani down the right. The Portuguese forward's low cross was spilled by Al-Habsi and Scholes was on hand to turn the ball into the net from six yards. A second followed eight minutes later, Buttner reacting first as Giggs's attempted cross was blocked and steering the ball across goal, where Hernandez beat the offside trap to score. Buttner added a third, rampaging down the left and beating Al-Habsi from an apparently impossible angle, before Powell, minutes after coming on as a substitute, added a fourth.

24.04.2013 23:34:16 QPR ended Chelsea's 100% Premier League record and secured just their second point this season as they earned a deserved draw from a niggly game. Anton Ferdinand's refusal to shake John Terry's hand before the match following allegations of racial abuse in the corresponding fixture last season set the tone for a feisty encounter. Chelsea had the better openings and had two strong penalty shouts dismissed. But QPR improved after the break and Bobby Zamora wasted a fine late chance. The striker was gifted a great one-on-one opening as he ran on to a calamitous Jon Mikel Obi backpass, but Blues keeper Petr Cech brilliantly delayed Zamora and the England frontman's effort was cleared off the line by Terry. Eden Hazard then had an equally glorious opportunity to secure Chelsea's fourth consecutive league success, but he shot wildly over after good work by substitute Victor Moses. The late chances in a fiery and at times controversial game, played in a predictably hostile Loftus Road atmosphere, at least offered some hope of it being remembered for the football. Almost all the pre-match focus inevitably centred on the handshake, and whether Terry and Ferdinand would try to move on from the incident last October that led, ultimately, to Terry being acquitted of racially abusing the QPR defender - although he still faces a separate FA charge. As expected, Ferdinand refused to shake the former England skipper's hand when offered the chance and also avoided Ashley Cole. An already simmering atmosphere hardly needed further tension, but there was plenty of incident despite the lack of goals. The European champions, who remain top of the table despite the draw, felt they were denied two clear penalties before the break. But referee Andre Marriner decided Ryan Nelsen was not guilty of grappling Terry to the floor from a free-kick, and then waved away even stronger protests after a clumsy Shaun Wright-Phillips challenge led to Hazard tumbling in the box. Chelsea, who have now won just two of their 18 top-flight games at Loftus Road, could have gone ahead inside the opening four minutes, but debutant Rangers keeper Julio Cesar made a fine block to keep out a low Hazard strike after a swift break. And Cesar also did well to keep out a decent Fernando Torres shot after the Spaniard showed some nifty footwork to cut in from the right flank. Chelsea's biggest concern appeared to be the keeping all 11 players on the pitch. Ramires and Ryan Bertrand - following a reckless lunge on Wright-Phillips - were both booked, and the indiscipline that cost them so dear in last season's meeting always threatened to resurface. QPR - despite being hampered by first-half injuries to Fabio and Andy Johnson - were solid, retained possession well and saw plenty of the ball. But apart from a Zamora shot that was beaten away by Cech, they barely threatened in the first period. They stepped up the pace after the interval, were the better side for lengthy periods and created the two best chances. Park Ji-sung spurned the first, somehow finding Cech with a free header from eight yards, before Zamora wasted the late gift from Mikel. Chelsea came back into it in the latter stages, mainly thanks to an impressive debut from Moses. He forced another decent stop from Cesar and also set up a wonderful chance for Hazard, who was unable to continue his blistering start to life in the Premier League, shooting wastefully over from 10 yards. Terry and Ferdinand both ended the match limping after picking up knocks, but both excelled defensively and were at least able to remind supporters what fine players they are. Ferdinand was particularly impressive, giving an assured display that was the main reason for his side's first clean sheet in the league this season.  QPR manager Mark Hughes:  "Today we acquitted ourselves really well. We were assured and calm and we dictated to the European champions for long periods. We were good in possession and created chances. "Credit to the players, I thought the performance was excellent. "Our concentration levels were excellent. It's early days for us but I have seen improvements in every game we have played and it's only a matter of time before it all comes together. Once everyone's up to speed and fitness levels are on a par then I have no doubt we will have a good season and we will see evidence of what a good side we are. "I missed the handshake. I was walking down the tunnel with Roberto Di Matteo. Our focus was on the game."  Chelsea manager Roberto Di Matteo:  "It was a feisty derby with tackles flying in. In the first half we were very much in control and had a number of opportunities to score and were only missing a goal. We also had two penalty incidents and it's a shame the referee didn't see them or think they were penalties. "The one on JT was an incredible one and the other one, maybe he thought there was not much contact [on Eden Hazard]. But it's a clean sheet and a draw away from home and we will take it.  On the pre-match handshake: "Everybody focused on the football and of course there would be high emotion but both sets of players played very professionally. As far as we are concerned, our players offered it and if the other player doesn't want to receive it, so we move on."

24.04.2013 23:34:16 Javi Garcia scored on his Manchester City debut to earn a point for his side against Stoke at the Britannia. Peter Crouch had fired the hosts ahead in controversial circumstances from close range, the England striker handling the ball before scoring. But Garcia levelled with a free header from Carlos Tevez's free-kick. Stoke sent on Michael Owen for his debut late on but City went closest to winning it when Edin Dzeko's lob was cleared off the line by Ryan Shawcross. Dzeko looked set to earn City a dramatic win with his late effort but centre-back Shawcross raced back to hack the ball clear to the relief of the home fans. Roberto Mancini is still without a win at the Britannia Stadium in six attempts as City boss and his side's performance was watched by Real Madrid assistant manager Jose Morais ahead of their Champions League game in the Spanish capital on Tuesday. The Premier League champions, who were missing injured forward Sergio Aguero and gave debuts to Scott Sinclair and Maicon, lacked sparkle in attack and there was also plenty of finger-pointing after Stoke went ahead, despite the controversy surrounding their goal. The last time Crouch scored against Manchester City the exiled England striker found the net in spectacular style from 30 yards, but this effort was very different. After the ball broke to Crouch in the box he bundled past three challenges but clearly used his left hand to control it before slamming a 15th-minute shot beyond City keeper Joe Hart. The visitors will feel agrieved referee Mark Clattenburg allowed the goal to stand but Mancini's side - still seeking their first clean sheet of the season - have only themselves to blame after failing to clear a Charlie Adam corner. Carlos Tevez, Mario Balotelli, back from an eye injury, and Yaya Toure all spurned chances before Spanish international Garcia, once of Real Madrid, showed terrific composure with a header as he connected with Tevez's free-kick. Stoke keeper Asmir Begovic produced a terrific save with his leg to keep out Yaya Toure after the home defence had been sliced wide open in the second half, and although the visitors are now unbeaten in 10 league games, the Britannia Stadium remains one of their least happy hunting grounds. In contrast the Potters are now without a Premier League win in 10 attempts and face a daunting game at Chelsea next weekend.

24.04.2013 23:34:16 Norwich are still searching for their first win of the season after a goalless draw with West Ham. The hosts had appeals for a first-half penalty rejected, with the referee correctly adjudging Andrew Surman to have been fouled just outside the area. West Ham crafted several openings too, with Canaries keeper John Ruddy forced into a number of point-blank saves. But neither side could break the deadlock, leaving Norwich winless and West Ham frustrated on their travels. The visitors were having to manage without loan signing Andy Carroll, a hamstring strain ruling the forward out of the Carrow Road contest. Carlton Cole deputised in attack for the Hammers, who started the stronger in an open, fluid game. The Canaries' England international goalkeeper Ruddy was forced into a series of impressive close-range saves, denying Ricardo Vaz Te, Cole and Kevin Nolan in the space of eight first-half minutes. In response, Norwich surged forward with Surman - brought into the starting XI to replace the injured Anthony Pilkington - curling a dangerous effort just wide of Jussi Jaaskelainen's right-hand post. When Hammers centre-back James Collins then dived in recklessly on the same player on the edge of the box, there were vociferous penalty appeals. However, referee Chris Foy - who had already turned down one Canaries claim when Robert Snodgrass fell under the challenge of West Ham captain Nolan - was adamant the foul was outside the area. He awarded a free-kick and cautioned Collins, Norwich failing to profit from the dead ball. Norwich continued to have the better of the game in the second half, Simeon Jackson cracking a fierce 25-yard drive at Jaaskelainen that the Finn could only palm over the bar. The Canaries restricted West Ham to a series of corners and long-range efforts, with substitute Matt Jarvis blazing over from distance, and they could, and possibly should, have snatched a win at the end. On-loan Tottenham teenager Harry Kane advanced on the West Ham goal having been played through by Snodgrass, only to shoot tamely. Moments later Kane beat Guy Demel and tried to return the favour by cutting the ball back to Snodgrass, but the Scotland international's effort was blocked. A header from Steve Morison straight at Jaaskelainen was the last action of the fixture, as Norwich recorded their first 0-0 draw in the league since January and only their second clean sheet in 18 games.  Norwich manager Chris Hughton:  "We will look at the positives as it's a clean sheet against a strong powerful West Ham side who will trouble a lot of teams this season. "But we had better chances and, as long as we can continue to play with that tempo and attitude, it will come. I'm disappointed as I felt we could have won. "It's about quality and a little bit of fortune. We got into some very good positions and that final decision or pass could have been a little better. "If we weren't creating chances I would be worried. Harry Kane will learn a lot from this experience. I think he will be a super player."  West Ham boss Sam Allardyce:  "For a goalless draw it was particularly exciting considering the amount of chances there were. In the end, neither of us had the quality to put the ball in the net. "From our point of view it is a well-earned point. "It is our first point away from home this season and another clean sheet is very satisfying. That's three clean sheets from four since our return to the Premier League and that is a basis to build from."

24.04.2013 23:34:16 Hatem Ben Arfa's spectacular strike earned Newcastle a draw as they came from behind to deny Paul Lambert a first league win as Aston Villa boss. Villa had lost Lambert's first two games in charge and, though there may be a tinge of disappointment at missing out on three points, he will be relieved his side are off the mark. The visitors began strongly and took the lead through Ciaran Clark's header. But Newcastle drew level through Ben Arfa's brilliant 25-yard drive. After such an impressive campaign last season, the challenge for Newcastle was always going to be whether they could sustain the type of form which saw them finish fifth and qualify for the Europa League. Following their opening day win against Tottenham, they have now lost one and drawn one as manager Alan Pardew seeks a formula to cope with the challenges of combining the Premier League with European football.  Villa, meanwhile, might have been forgiven for beginning the game with a lack of confidence after two successive defeats at the start of the Premier League campaign. But, putting aside their recent poor record on Tyneside - they had conceded 10 goals on their previous three visits - Villa probed patiently and deservedly went in front. A spell of pressure culminated in Clark putting them ahead midway through the first half, the 22-year-old finding himself in an unusually advanced position to head home from Barry Bannan's precise left-wing cross. The lead was merited, particularly since Darren Bent had gone close to opening the scoring moments earlier, only for his low drive to be thwarted by the legs of Tim Krul. The goal was a reward for their approach under their new manager, and the Scot was at pains to tell his side to keep hold of the ball throughout, gesticulating angrily at every stray pass. But Newcastle are a force on their own turf, where they had won five of their previous six games, and possess the firepower to trouble any defence. Their response was a positive one, with Papiss Cisse and Demba Ba always threatening through their lively movement. The home supporters felt they should have had a penalty when Ba tumbled under a challenge from Eric Lichaj, but the defender would have felt hard done by had referee Lee Probert pointed to the spot. Cisse and Ba had their chances - the former's shot was tipped around the post by Brad Guzan and he headed wide on the stroke of half-time - but it was another of last season's key players who finally made the breakthrough. Ben Arfa collected the ball on the edge of the area just before the hour mark with seemingly little danger, but he cut on to his weaker right foot and drilled a stunning drive beyond the reach of Guzan. Former Magpies midfielder Stephen Ireland might have snatched victory for Villa with 10 minutes remaining, but he smashed wildly off target when free inside the penalty area. Then, five minutes into stoppage-time, Yohan Cabaye's 25-yard free-kick looked to be heading in but Guzan, picked ahead of Shay Given, saved acrobatically.  Aston Villa manager Paul Lambert: "I thought we were excellent throughout, offensively and defensively. Some of the football we played was very good. We've got a young side and every one of them was very good. We'd rather try to play football than not and we've got really good players in our team. If we keep working as hard as that we'll do well. We're getting stronger."

24.04.2013 23:34:16 Reading's hopes of avoiding relegation suffered another massive blow as they were well beaten by a Southampton side who have all but secured safety. The Royals, managed by former Saints boss Nigel Adkins, made a bright start but faded badly after Jay Rodriguez slid in to give Southampton the lead. The visitors' dominance brought further reward when Adam Lallana slotted the second past Adam Federici. Reading rarely threatened as they slumped to a seventh successive loss. It is a Premier League run that only the Royals' own sequence earlier in the campaign can match this season, and one that leaves them seven points adrift of 17th-placed Wigan, who also have two games in hand. Southampton, in contrast, are seven points clear of the relegation zone after a third successive league win. Adkins, facing the club who sacked him in January following a five-game unbeaten league run, cut a forlorn figure as he watched his new recruits outplayed and out-thought by the side he put together. Lining up with five changes from the side thrashed 4-1 by Arsenal last weekend, Reading started positively and came close to scoring when an unmarked Sean Morrison headed Chris Gunter's free-kick over the bar. Another free-kick from almost the same spot presented the hosts with an even better opportunity midway through the half as the ball bobbled off two Southampton players to the Royals' top-scorer Adam Le Fondre, who sliced his half-volley high. The chance marked the start of an uncomfortable spell for Southampton in which the hosts were denied a penalty when Hal Robson-Kanu went down under a challenge from Jos Hooiveld and Adrian Mariappa's header from Guthrie's cross drew a sharp save from Saints keeper Artur Boruc at his near post. The visitors, for their part, enjoyed plenty of possession but did not threaten Federici's goal until the 35th minute, when Gaston Ramirez headed Jack Cork's cross narrowly wide. Moments later, the visitors were ahead. Rodriguez laid the ball off to Lambert and chased down his strike partner's chipped return. Reaching the ball a fraction of a second before Federici, he slid in to prod the ball home through the keeper's legs. Rodriguez's momentum took him through Federici, prompting angry calls from Adkins for a foul, but referee Mike Jones awarded the goal. Suddenly rampant, the Saints could then have put the game beyond their hosts before half-time. Rodriguez drilled a shot against the bar from 10 yards, then brought a one-handed save out of Federici after a mistake from Mariappa. The loose ball fell kindly for Ramirez but he dragged his side-footed effort wide. Reading's defensive frailties were exposed again early in the second half as Steven Davis sprinted on to Lambert's volleyed pass only to shoot tamely at Federici. And shortly afterwards, Lambert came within a boot's length of toe-poking home a low cross from Rodriguez. The second goal came from another flowing move as substitute Lallana played a one-two with Rodriguez and calmly side-footed his 50th Southampton goal. Reading resorted to a more direct approach and it almost paid dividends when a long ball found Le Fondre, whose header was caught - and almost carried over his line - by a back-pedalling Boruc. Reading's players and fans screamed for a goal but replays suggested the whole of the ball had not crossed the line. Angry and frustrated, the Royals supporters started to flood out of the stadium in the last 10 minutes, knowing that their team's days in the Premier League are likely to be running out.

24.04.2013 23:34:16 Robin van Persie's stoppage-time header completed a memorable hat-trick to rescue Manchester United a victory over Southampton in a pulsating encounter. Rickie Lambert headed Saints in front, before Van Persie produced a touch of class to volley United level. But the hosts got themselves back in front with a header from Morgan Schneiderlin before Van Persie's dinked penalty was well saved by Kelvin Davis. United poured forward and the Netherlands striker looked to have rescued a point when he stabbed home a rebound. But the former Arsenal captain was not satisfied and wrapped up all three points with a superb near-post header to ensure Sir Alex Ferguson was victorious in his 1,000th league match in charge of United. For Saints it was a desperately disappointing end to what had been a cracking game in which they fully played their part. After an encouraging start against Manchester City and a poor defeat by Wigan they are still without a point following their promotion back to the Premier League. But if this performance is anything to go by, Nigel Adkins' side will not have to wait too much longer for a first league victory. In Adam Lallana and James Ward-Prowse they have two of the brightest young talents in the Premier League. The Saints, who have conceded eight goals in their three league games, will have to sharpen up at the back, though. At the other end of the table, if Van Persie - who now has 100 Premier League goals - can continue his form for the majority of this season, Ferguson has every chance of securing United their 20th top-flight title. The Dutchman was a menace throughout and showed his class with three expertly taken goals. The occasion seemed to get the better of the hosts in the opening exchanges and in the sixth minute Van Persie fired a volley just wide. But after a bright start from United, it was the Saints who took the lead when Lambert outjumped Rafael at the back post to head home his second of the season. United were soon on level terms though, when Â£24m signing Van Persie fired home a half volley at the back post after a fine cross from Antonio Valencia. Shinji Kagawa went close for United either side of half-time while Van Persie side-footed wide when unmarked in the area. Saints were looking lively on the break and it came as no real surprise when Schneiderlin headed them back in front from Lambert's cross, taking advantage of Patrice Evra's slip to beat Anders Lindegaard from close range. United introduced Paul Scholes and the veteran midfielder immediately created a chance for Van Persie, who fired straight at Davis from a tight angle. Ferguson's men should have been level moments later after Jos Hooiveld scythed down Van Persie in the box. But the forward could only watch in horror as the Saints keeper flung himself to his right and, at full stretch, managed to palm the chipped penalty around the post. Van Persie, though, was not to be denied and his late brace was enough to give Ferguson victory in his landmark match.  Southampton manager Nigel Adkins: "For a newly-promoted club we have scored two goals in open play against a Manchester United side packed full of experience. [Rickie] Lambert had an exceptional game, Jason Puncheon had a superb game, as did Adam Lallana. "I thought they had worked very hard and we made the substitutions to bring more energy into the side. [But] you get punished at the highest level."

24.04.2013 23:34:16 Arsenal secured their first victory of the season in impressive style at Anfield as they won comfortably against a desperately poor Liverpool. Arsene Wenger's summer signings Lukas Podolski and Santi Cazorla scored their first goals for the club either side of the interval to leave new manager Brendan Rodgers presiding over Liverpool's worst start since 1962-63. Arsenal had the game's outstanding performers in Cazorla and Abou Diaby and a third successive clean sheet will also have delighted Wenger and his new right-hand man Steve Bould. The difficulties are mounting swiftly for Rodgers. He has to deal with a shortage of attacking resources after Liverpool failed to replace Andy Carroll following his loan move to West Ham United.   Liverpool 0-2 Arsenal  And to make matters worse, the decline of goalkeeper Pepe Reina continues as he was again badly at fault for Cazorla's second goal that settled the destiny of the points. That followed his mistake that allowed David Templeton's shot to go through him against Hearts in the Europa League on Thursday. These are crucial early days for Rodgers and their next league test is a difficult trip to Sunderland. Raheem Sterling, just 17, offered moments of hope for Liverpool but they were few and far between as more experienced and illustrious team-mates failed to exert any influence over affairs. Arsenal were dominant in all areas, with Diaby ruling midfield and Cazorla proving what a bargain he is after a Â£15m move from Malaga. For two managers who pride themselves on the passing game, Rodgers and Wenger will have been aghast at the number of careless passes and errors that littered an undistinguished first period. And it was from one such moment of careless, with Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard the culprit, that Arsenal took the lead after 31 minutes. Gerrard conceded possession as he tried to find Luis Suarez, allowing Cazorla to surge forward and play in Podolski for a clinical finish that the German striker took with great expertise. In among the mediocrity surrounding him, Sterling was again creating a good impression and he almost produced an equaliser with a neat turn inside the box and a powerful shot against the outside of an upright. The power of Diaby was a feature of the first half and another run through the heart of Liverpool's defence should have brought a second Arsenal goal, only for Olivier Giroud to somehow sweep a simple opportunity wide. Liverpool appealed for a penalty when Suarez clashed with Per Mertesacker, who had been booked early on after another collision with the Uruguayan, but referee Howard Webb angered The Kop by waving play on. Reina needed to be alert to block a shot from Kieran Gibbs at his near post and from Carl Jenkinson's long-range effort. Suarez was fighting a lone battle against Mertesacker and Thomas Vermaelen but at least offered Liverpool some hope with a rising drive that was touched over by Vito Mannone. This was snuffed out when Cazorla added Arsenal's second after 69 minutes. The Spaniard's shot carried plenty of power but Reina should have done much better than merely help it into the net. Liverpool's lack of threat will have alarmed Rodgers but at least substitute Jonjo Shelvey, on for debutant Nuri Sahin, was prepared to test Mannone, twice bringing saves with efforts from distance. Anfield was deserting rapidly as the final whistle was blown - optimism for Wenger and a desperately poor start for Rodgers.  Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger:  "The sharpness gets better from game to game and we looked solid and scored two good goals. "I believe it is encouraging, playing at two difficult away games so I am pleased. We missed opportunities on the counter-attack at the start of the game but we had a convincing team performance. As long as you don't concede, everyone feels better but I credit the whole team. "Abou Diaby gets better every game but we need to be cautious with him because he has had so many injuries. He can have a little breather in the international break. "Everybody understood quickly Cazorla would not need six months to settle. Lukas Podolski is deadly when he gets a chance. I am pleased for them."

24.04.2013 23:34:16 Manchester City maintained their unbeaten start to the season with victory against Queen's Park Rangers at The Etihad. The Premier League champions were watched by Real Madrid coach Jose Mourinho ahead of their Champions League meetings - and he saw City win despite a performance that was not entirely convincing. Yaya Toure gave City the lead in a first half they dominated completely but QPR shocked Roberto Mancini's side when Bobby Zamora levelled entirely against the run of play on the hour. City were back in front through Edin Dzeko inside two minutes before Carlos Tevez added a third in stoppage time to end any lingering anxiety from the home supporters. This was a repeat of the momentous fixture on 13 May when Sergio Aguero's injury time goal gave City their first title in 44 years, but there was little of that sparkle surrounding this day and for Mancini this was ultimately about getting the job done. QPR boss Mark Hughes harboured hopes of an unlikely point for periods in the second half but much of his body language spoke of frustration at his side's failings and there is little doubt he will be eager to use many of the new players who have fleshed out his squad in recent weeks. City spent Â£38m on the final day of the transfer window - but Â£6.2m Scott Sinclair was the only new face on show on the bench. QPR have embarked on a wholesale reconstruction of their squad since avoiding relegation despite losing at City on the final day of last season and boss Hughes gave an immediate debut to Â£8m purchase from Real Madrid Esteban Granero. Apart from one shot at goal, Granero had little more than a watching - or more precisely running - brief as City dominated possession to an almost embarrassing degree in the first half. City, perhaps to their frustration, had only one goal to show for their superiority at the interval after Toure scored through a crowd after QPR failed to clear a corner they had contested. Fabio da Silva, on loan from Manchester United, had already cleared Dzeko's header off the line as QPR were penned in their own half for almost the entire period. The pattern continued after the break as QPR keeper Robert Green blocked Dzeko's shot and Pablo Zabaleta's curling effort hit the bar after he was played in by David Silva. City's failure to make QPR pay resulted in punishment just on the hour when the bandaged Zamora headed in a simple chance after keeper Joe Hart saved Andrew Johnson's powerful shot. The shock stung City into action and they were back in front inside two minutes when the tireless Tevez pulled back for Dzeko to head in at the near post. Despite controlling so much of the game, the champions had not wrapped up the points and they had a moment of concern with 12 minutes remaining as Ryan Nelsen just failed to meet Granero's cross at the far post. It was the last serious threat and the excellent Tevez completed the formalities in the closing moments when he touched Dzeko's shot past Green.

24.04.2013 23:34:16 Steven Fletcher scored twice on his Sunderland debut to end Swansea's perfect start to the season. The Â£14m new signing pounced on Ashley Williams's mistake before curling the ball expertly into the bottom corner. Swansea responded almost immediately when Wayne Routledge fired home from 10 yards, but Fletcher tapped in at the far post just before half-time. Michu's powerful header secured a point for the home side, who survived despite Chico's red card 20 minutes from time. In fact, Swansea continued to look the most likely scorers in the closing stages, having forced Sunderland firmly on the back foot from the start of a dominant second half. Crucial blocks and well-timed tackles in their own area by visiting defenders denied unchanged Swansea their third consecutive win of the season as Sunderland collected their second point from two games. Having kept clean sheets in their two opening victories, Swansea's defending looked far from assured as they gifted Sunderland both goals. Williams was the first offender, horribly miscuing his attempted back-pass, and giving Fletcher a clear run at goal as half-time approached. As Michel Vorm left his line to close the angle, Fletcher opened up his body, curling the ball around the goalkeeper's outstretched hand just inside the far post. Swansea's equaliser had all the hallmarks of their intricate passing game as Michu fed Nathan Dyer on the edge of the area. He flicked the ball into Routledge's path, who drove the ball home. Following a lengthy delay as Swansea left-back Neil Taylor received treatment for a suspected broken ankle, there were six minutes of added time at the end of the first half. And less than a minute remained when former Wolves striker Fletcher restored Sunderland's lead against the run of play. Again it was a gift from the home defence as Vorm allowed Sebastian Larsson's cross to reach the far post, where Fletcher forced himself in front of a dithering Chico to tap in from two yards. Swansea found greater urgency after the break and there was an air of inevitability about Michu's equaliser. Having seen a powerful header bounce over the bar moments earlier, Michu rose to dispatch Jonathan de Guzman's cross into the bottom corner for his fourth goal of the season. A third Swansea goal looked a distinct possibility, but Chico's moment of madness halted their momentum. The defender was given a straight red after clipping Louis Saha's ear with his boot as the Sunderland substitute flicked the ball down the left touchline. Martin O'Neill's men failed to capitalise, though, and were fortunate that Dyer and De Guzman failed to connect properly with shots in front of goal in an enthralling climax. But they almost snatched a late winner when Saha's drive was well blocked by substitute Alan Tate after more calamitous defending.  Swansea City manager Michael Laudrup:  "I know we've won two games 5-0 and 3-0, but this game has given me most as a manager because everything was against us from the beginning. "A very serious injury for Neil [Taylor] after just 10 or 12 minutes, and the first mistake we make they score a goal. "Then we come back to 1-1 and then passed injury time they score to make it 2-1. Then we came back in the second half and played great football to get the draw."  Sunderland manager Martin O'Neill:  "Darren Bent did very well here and Steven [Fletcher] has come here to score goals. "But he can also do well for us outside the penalty area, he has a lovely touch, but it was very pleasing for him to get off the mark. "With all the euphoria of Adam [Johnson] signing for us he was maybe in his shadow a bit, but he is a very good player."

24.04.2013 23:34:16 Robert Snodgrass scored a dramatic late equaliser as Norwich consigned 10-man Tottenham to their worst start to a Premier League season for four years. Mousa Dembele had put the hosts on course for their first league win of the season with a goal on debut. But, with time running out, the Norwich midfielder found the space to unleash a low left-foot shoot that flashed beyond Spurs goalkeeper Brad Friedel. Substitute Tom Huddlestone was shown a straight red card in the 90th minute. Boos echoed around White Hart Lane at the final whistle, with Andre Villas-Boas still without a competitive win as Tottenham manager. There could be little dispute about the result, however. It was just reward for Chris Hughton's powers of organisation on an emotional day for the Norwich manager as he returned to the club where he had spent 28 years, as a player and then a coach. Villa-Boas could not afford to accommodate such sentiment. Having been beaten by Newcastle on the opening day and frustrated by West Brom last weekend, the pressing need for points and for that elusive first win was at the forefront in his mind. The wait goes on. This was a performance that epitomised Spurs' faltering progress so far this season: style but no substance, beauty but no brawn, panache but no penetration. Dembele's goal apart, Villa-Boas's side lacked confidence, cohesion and sustained threat. In contrast Norwich pushed and probed, frustrated and confounded their more celebrated opponents and their uncomplicated, direct approach put Spurs under serious duress. For a period during the second half it appeared Spurs might snatch victory thanks to Dembele's heroics but Snodgrass found the net with five minutes remaining. Norwich might have stolen all three points but for the brilliance of goalkeeper Brad Friedel. Twice during the first half the 41-year-old showed his apparent replacement, France goalkeeper Hugo Lloris, that he will have to be at his very best to displace him, first tipping Russell Martin's thundering header onto the crossbar before throwing himself to his right to prevent Snodgrass's clever header. Tactically smart, Norwich's work-rate was also admirable, their players often doubling up on Tottenham's main threats like Gareth Bale and Aaron Lennon. Jermain Defoe also found he had unwelcome, unstinting company. Norwich maintained their momentum after the interval as first Grant Holt headed over from six yards, before winger Anthony Pilkington drew another important save from Friedel. The introduction of the Â£15m Dembele and Emmanuel Adebayor shortly after the interval did alter the game, however. The former Fulham midfielder burst forward after 67 minutes, exchanging passes with Defoe and spinning beyond his defender before thumping a low shot across Norwich goalkeeper John Ruddy into the net. Aware that his team surrendered a 1-0 lead in injury-time last weekend, Villas-Boas brought Huddlestone on for his first game in just over a year but the visitors kept coming. They were denied a penalty when Benoit Assou-Ekotto appeared to pull substitute Steve Morison's shirt in the box with time running out but when Pilkington found Snodgrass in the penalty area with five minutes left, the former Leeds midfielder thundered home through a crowded penalty area to empty salt into an already raw wound. There was more disappointment for Spurs when Huddlestone was given a straight red for a mistimed tackle on Jonny Howson, while Bradley Johnson almost won it in injury time, only for Friedel to deny him again.

24.04.2013 23:34:16 Unbeaten West Bromwich Albion recorded their best start to a Premier League season, ending Everton's 100% winning run in the process at The Hawthorns. Baggies striker Shane Long swept in the close-range opener from substitute Peter Odemwingie's low left-wing cross. And Gareth McAuley's thumping header sealed victory as Everton lost for the first time in 12 top-flight games. Top scorer Marouane Fellaini slashed the Toffees' best chance wide just moments before Long's opener. Republic of Ireland international Long also rattled the Everton crossbar with a crashing first-half header as Steve Clarke's men deservedly leapfrogged their opponents into third. Everton have notoriously been slow starters in recent seasons but, after impressive wins against Manchester United and Aston Villa, were bidding for a third league victory in a row at the start of a campaign for the first time since 1993. But Albion made it seven points from their opening three Premier League games with a well-earned triumph. The reign of managerial novice Clarke, who was chosen to succeed Roy Hodgson in his first top appointment, has started with a wave of optimism. And after a confident display against Everton, which followed a comfortable home win against Liverpool and a dramatic last-gasp draw at Tottenham, there is a feel-good factor around this part of the West Midlands. Clarke, who enjoyed three wins against Everton as Liverpool assistant manager last season, showed he was not content to simply settle for a point when he introduced pacy attacker Odemwingie before the hour. And the Nigerian used his speed to accelerate away from Everton right-back Tony Hibbert before delivering an inch-perfect cross for Long to convert from inside the six-yard box. McAuley then lost his marker Fellaini to head in a right-wing corner from another of Clarke's substitutions, Chris Brunt, who was celebrating his 100th top-flight appearance. Both teams were clearly oozing confidence after their promising starts and showed a swagger in the early stages, settling quickly into crisp, passing phases of play. But there was a lack of incisiveness in the opening half-hour until only the woodwork denied Long heading Albion in front from Liam Ridgewell's cross. The visitors were shaken into life by the let-off and within seconds almost scored themselves when Fellaini looped a header onto the roof of the Baggies net. Then, he skewed substitute Kevin Mirallas's cross wide when unmarked in the home penalty area after the break. It proved costly with Long and then McAuley netting to leave Baggies fans celebrating at the final whistle.  West Bromwich Albion head coach Steve Clarke:  "We started a little bit slow in the first half, even though we had the best two chances. I felt second half we were a little bit more adventurous and got our reward for that. "Everton are a difficult team to play against and we didn't want to open up too early against them. We showed a bit of respect to Everton in the first half - probably too much."  Everton manager David Moyes:  "We made changes to try and win the game, brought Kevin Mirallas on, opened up the game a bit more. We weren't playing well enough in the final third, but it didn't improve anything. "We gave away a poor goal on the counter attack and if you concede first in the Premier League it becomes difficult. "Maybe when it was 0-0 I should have said 'sit back and take 0-0'. Sometimes you make decisions and they work - sometimes they don't."

24.04.2013 23:34:16 Peter Crouch earned Stoke a point after Franco Di Santo looked to have secured Wigan victory at the DW Stadium. Di Santo's fifth goal in eight Premier League games had put the Latics 2-1 ahead just after the break before Crouch powered home Jon Walters' cross. Walters had earlier levelled from the spot after Maynor Figueroa handled, which cancelled out Shaun Maloney's penalty that Robert Huth had conceded. New Stoke buy Charlie Adam was denied a winner by Ali Al Habsi's stunning save. Adam, who joined on Friday in a Â£4m deal from Liverpool, started his first match for the Potters on the substitutes bench. But the Scot lifted his team-mates after replacing Andy Wilkinson, who suffered a first half head injury, in what was the former Blackpool player's first taste of Premier League action since March. With the scores locked at 2-2, Adam thought he had scored a late winner with a deflected free-kick, which clipped Gary Caldwell, only for Al Habsi to produce a full stretch stop. The Wigan keeper had become a father for the second time overnight, but the Oman international was alert to frustrate Adam. It would have been harsh on the Latics had Adam scored. Wigan enjoyed plenty of possession and twice led only to be pegged back by a spirited Stoke side who restored some much needed pride after a surprise midweek League Cup exit at the hands of Swindon.  The Latics were gifted a fifth-minute lead when Huth handled James McCarthy's fierce drive, former Celtic player Maloney taking full advantage from the penalty spot to score his fourth goal in 16 Premier League appearances for the club. Roberto Martinez's team were the better side before the break, Stoke only coming to life after Adam replaced Wilkinson in the 36th minute. By then the Latics should have doubled their lead, Arouna Kone squandering a great opportunity from close range after Emmerson Boyce had hooked Di Santo's centre across the six-yard area. It proved a costly miss as Stoke levelled in the 40th minute, Walters scoring from the spot after referee Martin Atkinson had adjudged Figueroa of handling the ball inside his own area. Having been comfortable for long periods of the half, Wigan went in at the interval fortunate to be still on level terms after Marc Wilson rattled the bar from 20-yards. Yet Stoke's momentum was banished by Di Santo's exquisite 49th-minute finish, the Argentine picking his spot from just inside the area after Kone had done well to hold up possession while under pressure. Stoke, however, refused to lie down and secured a hard-earned point when Crouch scored his second goal in nine Premier League matches after meeting Walters' cross six-yards out.  Wigan manager Roberto Martinez:  "I think the best compliment you can say [regarding Al Habsi's late save] is that we are not surprised any more. "Ali keeps producing this level. Since he arrived at the DW Stadium he has become a bit of a hero and that is why - because when you really need him, he is always there. "We started really brightly and got the goal we deserved, but then you are looking at the manner in which the game opened up and it could have gone either way."  Stoke manager Tony Pulis:  "It was touch and go whether I started him [Charlie Adam] or not. "When he came on I thought the game had opened up a bit, and he is a good passer of the ball. "They are away now for internationals which is disappointing for all of us, but hopefully he will get bedded in to what we want to do and the way we want to use him, and he will be a great asset for the football club."

24.04.2013 23:34:16 Andy Carroll set up two goals on an impressive debut as West Ham cruised to victory against woeful Fulham. Carroll dominated the away defence and set the Hammers on the way after 53 seconds when his header let Ricardo Vaz Te tee up Kevin Nolan to fire home. Winston Reid powered in a free header from a corner to make it 2-0. Carroll, who later limped off with a tight hamstring, also played a part in the Matt Taylor strike which wrapped up back-to-back home Premier League wins. Carroll, who has joined on a season-long loan, left the Upton Park pitch to a standing ovation after 68 minutes and is likely to miss England's upcoming World Cup qualifiers against Moldova and Ukraine.  But by that time the Â£35m forward had already played a huge part in a victory that was secured with a rampant first half-display by the home side. Carroll was undoubtedly the catalyst, with his physical threat and aerial presence giving the Hammers a cutting edge and creating a platform for Taylor, Mohamed Diame and the excellent Vaz Te to run at a constantly exposed home defence. That was evident within a minute as Carroll's header allowed Vaz Te time to pick out Nolan, who drilled a fabulous first-time finish back across Mark Schwarzer and in at the far post. Fulham offered little response to the fastest Premier League goal of the season and appeared to badly miss the presence of influential midfielder Mousa Dembele following his move to Tottenham.  Steve Sidwell, Mahamadou Diarra and new recruit Kieran Richardson failed to get to grips with the pace and movement of West Ham's midfield, which was brilliantly led by Diame and Mark Noble. While Carroll will rightly take most of the plaudits, Vaz Te's pace and willingness to run at the visiting defence provided the biggest goal threat. He went close with a near-post effort and also played a fine crossfield pass which saw Carroll nod the ball back to Diame whose strike was tipped onto the bar by Schwarzer. A second home goal seemed inevitable and came when Reid was allowed a free run at Taylor's inswinging near-post corner to head home from six yards. Fulham had barely threatened, with long-range efforts from Damien Duff and Steve Sidwell as much as they could muster, and they could have no complaints at being 3-0 down at the interval. Carroll's presence from a free-kick drew the attention of three home defenders and when the ball broke loose, Taylor reacted first to smash a low half-volley into the corner of the net. Brede Hangeland almost got a goal back on the stroke of half-time but Fulham never looked like getting back into the match despite an improved second-half performance. Their main hope came in the form of their own deadline day recruit Dimitar Berbatov, who showed flashes of his undoubted quality during an encouraging appearance as a second-half substitute. He nearly teed up a late goal for Hugo Rodallega, whose shot forced a decent block from Jussi Jaaskelainen, while Duff also went close. But West Ham had already done the hard work before the break and were able to sit deep, defend their lead and ease to victory.  Fulham manager Martin Jol on his side's failure to deal with Andy Carroll:  "If you are 5ft 8ins or 5ft 10ins tall maybe you have got a problem but we should have coped with it. "Every game you see him, in the European Championships, you see he is good in the air, he is probably the best in the Premier League but I still feel there are a few answers for that but we couldn't cope with that. "The only positive for today was to see Dimitar Berbatov again and to see his class and quality, I have missed it. "What I did see was Berbatov brought other players into his play and that is his quality. Hopefully with Bryan (Ruiz) available for the next match...we should be a bit more positive. "I tried everything but we missed out on a couple of players yesterday and in the end we have to be happy that Berbatov is there and Rodallega and Petric. "Dembele, I really felt he would have stayed because Â£15m is a big clause, but they paid up and they always do that in the last week, I know that from my time there so it made life miserable for me."

24.04.2013 23:34:16 Martin Skrtel's calamitous late error gave Premier League champions Manchester City a point they barely deserved against Liverpool after a pulsating game at Anfield. Liverpool looked on course to give new manager Brendan Rodgers his first Premier League victory until defender Skrtel directed a backpass straight to Carlos Tevez, who took full advantage of the gift to score with 10 minutes left and grab his 100th goal in English football. Skrtel's powerful header gave Liverpool a lead they fully deserved at half-time - only for another defensive mix-up to hand Yaya Toure a scrambled equaliser for Roberto Mancini's side after the break. Luis Suarez's precise free-kick restored Liverpool's advantage, but Skrtel's mistake handed City a reprieve in a moment that saw Rodgers slump into his seat on the sidelines in despair. City will be grateful to leave Anfield with a draw after a mediocre display, while Rodgers can take plenty of solace in a Liverpool performance that showed plenty of encouraging signs and indications that his players are buying into his philosophy. The biggest positives for Rodgers came in the shape of an exciting league debut from 17-year-old Raheem Sterling, and the manner in which the assured Joe Allen dictated the tempo and controlled possession in midfield. Rodgers demonstrated his willingness to put his faith in youth and hunger when more experienced players fail to deliver - hence his decision to prefer Sterling to Â£20m Stewart Downing. And the young winger played his full part in a vibrant first-half display from Liverpool as City struggled to pick up the pace of the game. Sterling was causing problems for Kolo Toure, selected ahead of Joleon Lescott, and he should have provided Liverpool's opening goal. He delivered a teasing cross that found Fabio Borini at the near post, but the Italian could only bundle his effort wide from eight yards. City's response came via Tevez, whose industry in the opening exchanges was in stark contrast to the laboured efforts of Mario Balotelli as he attempted to fill the gap left by the injured Sergio Aguero. And he was almost on the mark when he forced the ball past Liverpool keeper Pepe Reina from an acute angle but the ball rebounded to safety off an upright. Liverpool, who lost Lucas to injury in only the fourth minute, were showing the sharpness in possession that Rodgers wants to make his trademark with Allen, his Â£15m signing from Swansea City, a prominent figure. They were pressing City back and thoroughly deserved the lead they were given by Skrtel after 34 minutes. The defender rose majestically to meet Steven Gerrard's corner and thump an unstoppable header past City keeper Joe Hart in front of the Kop. City's sloppiness in possession almost cost them again early in the second half when Borini broke clear to set up Suarez but the Uruguayan could only steer a half-hit effort well off target. Mancini made a double change in an attempt to galvanise his team, with Jack Rodwell and Edin Dzeko replacing Samir Nasri and Balotelli - with the intention of allowing Yaya Toure to become more of a threat. It worked almost instantly as Toure took advantage of poor defending from Liverpool when they failed to deal with Tevez's cross, turning from close range against the run of play. City were only on terms for three minutes before Liverpool restored their advantage. Rodwell was penalised for handling Gerrard's effort and Liverpool's captain left it to Suarez to sweep a 25-yard free-kick low into Hart's bottom left hand corner. Liverpool had regained the initiative but were denied all three points when Skrtel allowed City to claim a draw.

24.04.2013 23:34:16 Arsenal are still searching for their first goal of the season as they shared a tame goalless draw with Stoke. Santi Cazorla was again their most impressive performer and tested Asmir Begovic, but others struggled to create any clear-cut opportunities. Lukas Podolski had an early effort that hit the falling Andy Wilkinson's arm, while Olivier Giroud's shot was just over as the Gunners finished strongly. Stoke's Jon Walters was also wasteful and had no power in his late prod. The hosts had little else to point to as they too shared their second draw of the season. Arsenal dominated possession but did not possess any real endeavour until late in the game - that coincided with the late introduction of Theo Walcott and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, who replaced the disappointing Lukas Podolski and Gervinho. And the lack of cutting edge will give Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger food for thought as he continues to rebuild his attacking options after the departure of last season's top scorer Robin van Persie to Manchester United. Giroud's diagonal lob in the dying stages almost caught out Stoke keeper Begovic, but his decision to shoot rather than pass to the onrushing Aaron Ramsey was one example of how the Frenchman still needs time to link with his new team-mates as he made his full debut. Tony Pulis's side will be more content with the point as they failed to fashion too many chances, although they had an early Walters effort ruled out for offside and Jermaine Pennant was furious when he claimed he was pushed over by Kieran Gibbs in the penalty area. In keeping with his performance against Sunderland last week, Arsenal's Cazorla was quick to run the show in midfield, proving equally adept with either foot and finding space with ease. But where Arsenal showed promise in the attacking third, with Podolski dropping inside to support Cazorla, they could not create many attempts on the Stoke goal in the first half. The hosts handed a debut to American Geoff Cameron in place of the suspended Dean Whitehead and he became the latest of Stoke's long throw-in specialists, though they rarely troubled the Gunners defence. And after the interval, Stoke were limited to Walters's late poke with only Vito Mannone - making his first Premier League start for almost three years in place of the injured Wojciech Szczesny - to beat. Once Arsenal finally gathered some momentum, Giroud, Abou Diaby and Mikel Arteta failed to work Begovic with speculative efforts, but at least the Gunners can take some satisfaction from two consecutive clean sheets, a sign perhaps that new assistant Steve Bould is having some effect.

24.04.2013 23:34:16 QPR's hopes of top-flight survival are hanging by a thread after a damaging defeat by a Dimitar Berbatov-inspired Fulham in a riveting encounter. Berbatov capitalised on two Christopher Samba errors before Clint Hill's own-goal handed the hosts a 3-0 lead. Adel Taarabt gave QPR hope with a low strike before half-time and Loic Remy reduced the deficit to a single goal moments after missing a penalty. Fulham's Steve Sidwell was sent off but QPR were unable to conjure a late goal. In fact, when faced with 10 men, QPR's efforts smacked more of desperation than precision as they slid to a defeat which leaves them seven points adrift of safety with seven games remaining. It is a position from which no team in Premier League history has survived the drop and one which may leave even manager Harry Redknapp privately admitting that the game is up. Samba's signing for Â£12.5m from Anzhi Makhachkala on the last day of the January transfer window was supposed to provide QPR with the type of defensive solidity required to get results in the top flight. Instead, he was guilty of two elementary mistakes which left his team staring into the mire. Ashkan Dejagah collected the ball just inside the box and nicked it past Samba, who stretched out a leg and upended his opponent. With a languid swing of his right boot, Berbatov sent Julio Cesar the wrong way from the penalty spot for his fourth goal in successive games. Samba inadvertently saved his side from going 2-0 behind when Brede Hangeland's flicked header deflected off his back. But he was at fault once again midway through the first half when he attempted to dribble the ball out of defence. Under pressure from Damien Duff, Samba lost control of the ball and presented it to Berbatov, inviting the Bulgarian striker to waltz his way into the box and slide a shot under Cesar with the outside of his right foot. QPR rebounded with a dominant spell in which Bobby Zamora and Remy both wasted good opportunities, only for Fulham to snatch a third goal five minutes before the break. A deft back-heel from Hangeland took John Arne Riise to the byline and the Norwegian's cut-back deflected off Hill's shoulder and into the net. QPR were handed a lifeline when a wayward pass from Greek midfielder Giorgos Karagounis gave Taarabt the chance to run at goal. The Moroccan held off Hangeland and fired his shot into the far corner of Mark Schwarzer's goal from the edge of the area. QPR made an electric start to the second half, launching a series of raids on the home side's goal and winning a penalty when Karagounis clumsily tripped Taarabt. But Schwarzer guessed the direction of Remy's spot-kick and pulled off a sharp one-handed save. A frantic, thrilling game took another twist moments later when Remy atoned for his penalty miss. Latching on to Stephane Mbia's through-ball, he spun away from Philippe Senderos and crashed a shot home off the underside of the bar. Suddenly the outcome of the game was in the balance with QPR sensing their chance to complete a remarkable comeback. A rasping drive from Andros Townsend was pushed aside by Schwarzer before Samba controlled the ball brilliantly in the area but dragged his left-footed shot wide. Remy sliced a shot after twisting past Hangeland and Zamora drew a one-handed save from Schwarzer with a fierce drive. QPR's hopes were handed a boost with 12 minutes left on the clock when Sidwell was sent off for an ugly, late tackle on Armand Traore. Redknapp responded by replacing his left-back with striker Jamie Mackie and throwing Samba into attack. But, with men packed behind the ball, QPR failed to create a clear opening and Fulham hung on to take the points.  Fulham manager Martin Jol: "It was two different halves. We played much better than QPR in the first half but we gave them the present with the 3-1 and then in the second half we made mistakes like they made in the first half. "I think we will be fine but we shouldn't have conceded a second goal and we needed our keeper again to save a penalty, but overall disappointing that after being 3-0 up we made it difficult for ourselves." On Steve Sidwell's red card: "The red card was a bit harsh I think. I can see why the referee gave it but he was unfortunate because you could see Steve wanted to pull out of the tackle." On whether 39 points will be enough to stay up: "Hopefully 39 points is enough but it is a tough competition, probably the only one in the world where the team in 10th could still possibly go down."

24.04.2013 23:34:17 Fernando Torres produced a masterclass in forward play to help Chelsea to a deserved victory over Newcastle. The Blues attack were at their fluent best, with Â£32m signing Eden Hazard scoring his first goal for the club when he converted from the spot after Torres was fouled by Vurnon Anita. The Spain striker made it 2-0 before the break, latching on to Hazard's backheel to rifle in from 18 yards. The goals were enough to send the Blues to the top of the Premier League table. And on this performance, Chelsea, who have now won their first three league games, must now be regarded as serious title challengers. Ever since Roberto Di Matteo took charge of team affairs last March, the club's rise from their rut has been remarkable. And one player who has benefited greatly from the change in management is Torres. The Spaniard ended his 24-game goalscoring drought when Andre Villas-Boas was replaced and was then influential in guiding Chelsea to the Champions League title and helping Spain retain the European Championship. And on Saturday, under dark rainclouds at Stamford Bridge, Torres once again shone brightly. His first contribution came midway through the first half, when he outwitted Davide Santon with a change of pace before he was tripped in the area by his next obstacle, Anita. Hazard, who along with Juan Mata and Torres, graced the pitch with numerous magical moments, converted low to Tim Krul's right. The Belgian playmaker then provided the key touch for Torres as he delivered a powerful strike past the reach of Newcastle Dutch keeper for Chelsea's second. It was the Spaniard's sixth goal in nine games for club and country. The Blues' defence was barely tested in the first half, but were made to work a little harder after the break. France midfielder Hatem Ben Arfa was his usual precocious self, frequently teasing Chelsea's right. He was rarely given a sight on goal though, and when he did on one occasion, the former Marseille player dragged his low shot wide of Petr Cech's left-hand upright. Demba Ba, who scored in Newcastle's opening-day victory over Tottenham, had the Magpies' best chances - forcing two good saves from Cech and heading over from six yards. Unlike at the end of last season, there were to be no jack-in-the-box moments from Newcastle striker Papiss Cisse, who had a very quiet game. Such memorable moments were provided by the Chelsea number nine instead.

24.04.2013 23:34:17 Steven Pienaar, Marouane Fellaini and Nikica Jelavic all scored as Paul Lambert suffered a nightmare first home league game in charge of Aston Villa. Pienaar's delightful 20-yard finish set Everton on their way and they doubled the lead after keeper Shay Given's mistake allowed Fellaini to score. Everton added a third before half-time when Jelavic netted from close range. Villa, who had Ciaran Clark sent off for a foul on Jelavic, grabbed a consolation through Karim El Ahmadi. While Everton are now unbeaten in 11 Premier League games stretching back to March, problems are mounting at Villa after they lost their opening two Premier League games of the season for the first time since the 2002-03 campaign. They finished 16th in the table back then, and another long season appears to be on the cards for the West Midlands club after Lambert saw his team outclassed and outfought by the determined visitors. Lambert has been busy in the transfer market since his appointment - Villa signing Ron Vlaar, Matthew Lowton, Brett Holman and El Ahmadi during the summer. But it is a case of new faces, same old story. Even under the unpopular Alex McLeish, who lasted less than a year in charge before being replaced by Lambert in June, Villa took four points from the first two games last season. Everton were everything Villa were not - bright, hungry, sharp and creative. Not only did Fellaini score his second goal in as many games, Pienaar scored his first since re-signing from Tottenham last month, while Jelavic now has 10 goals in 15 Premier League appearances. But there were telling contributions from Leighton Baines and Phil Neville, the full-backs eager to get forward at every opportunity to supply the ammunition for Fellaini, Pienaar and Jelavic. There was only one winner once Pienaar opened the scoring with a stylish fourth-minute finish, a delightful 20-yard attempt beyond Given after Steven Naismith's clever lay-off. Jelavic twice spurned good opportunities before Fellaini doubled the lead in the 32nd minute after Phil Jagielka's cross, Given allowing the ball to squirm past him when he should have done much better. Villa managed just one shot on target in the first half - Barry Bannan testing Tim Howard - but Everton were already 3-0 ahead after Jelavic's 44th minute close range finish following good work by Baines. It was damage limitation for Villa long before Clark was shown a straight red for bringing down Jelavic, and they were forced to play for more than half an hour with only 10 men. Everton, who introduced new signing Kevin Mirallas from the substitutes' bench in the closing stages, were denied a fourth goal when Bent cleared off the line from Sylvain Distin. But Villa finished strongly, El Ahmadi firing his new team's first goal of the season in the 75th minute with a curling finish before Andreas Weimann hit the post in injury time.

24.04.2013 23:34:17 Robin van Persie crowned his full debut for Manchester United with a stunning first goal for his new club in a nervy win against Fulham. The Dutchman's strike came after Damien Duff had given the visitors the lead, and it came in a scintillating first half as Shinji Kagawa and Rafael added further goals. David De Gea turned Mladen Petric's point-blank effort on to the bar but the United keeper then failed to reach a Fulham cross as Nemanja Vidic deflected into his own net. And when it looked like United might throw away their advantage, the Spaniard stopped Moussa Dembele's close-range shot before the home side finally restored a measure of calm to the game. A late injury to substitute Wayne Rooney and defensive worries aside, where Michael Carrick again had moments of alarm as a stand-in centre-back, Sir Alex Ferguson's side were dominant for large periods of the game and they could easily have scored more as Kagawa hit a post and Rafael had a second goal disallowed. The successful introduction of Van Persie in an alternative 4-2-3-1 system left United fans purring about his attacking threat and he may have to play without Rooney in coming games, after the England striker suffered a nasty gash to his thigh following his introduction as a second-half substitute.  That worrying finish to the game, when Rooney was caught by Hugo Rodallega, was in contrast to a buoyant beginning after six-time Olympic sprint champion Usain Bolt was paraded to cheers of "Fergie, Fergie sign him up" before kick-off. The party mood was punctured after three minutes, however, when Duff tucked in Bryan Ruiz's clever free-kick, although there were question marks about the hosts' marking. The lull did not last long as the impressive Antonio Valencia probed down the right, and when Van Persie marked his full debut in stunning fashion there was a huge roar to blow away any thoughts of a spoiled occasion. The Dutchman's goal came from the left when Patrice Evra crossed and Van Persie met it after one bounce with a superb strike into the opposite corner. It immediately put any minor queries about his role in the United attack to bed, and his link-up play with Kagawa just behind him showed signs of a more fluid system which could suit United in Europe. The Japanese midfielder, a summer signing from Borussia Dortmund, then helped himself to a home debut goal on 35 minutes when he tucked in from close range after Mark Schwarzer saved Tom Cleverley's shot following a corner. And it began a frantic 10 minutes before the break where Kagawa hit the post and Rafael had a goal disallowed for offside before the Brazilian full-back headed in Ashley Young's centre. Fulham should have pulled one back moments later but somehow De Gea turned Petric's effort on to the bar, with Ruiz firing over from five yards. Having established a two-goal cushion, United reduced their tempo after the interval but, similar to last season's 4-4 draw with Everton, which proved crucial in the eventual destination of the title, they carelessly let the Cottagers back into the game via a defensive howler. There appeared to be no danger when Matthew Briggs crossed from the left but De Gea got the wrong side of Petric as Vidic inadvertently back-heeled into his own goal. De Gea made amends for that clanger by saving twice from Dembele and he also stopped a late Ruiz header with Vidic also blocking Rodallega's shot. And although United tested the Fulham goal further, they will hope their quartet of injured centre-backs - including Rio Ferdinand and Phil Jones - is back in action soon to shore up the defence.

24.04.2013 23:34:17 Norwich and QPR recovered from opening-day hammerings to register their first points of the season. Simeon Jackson headed Norwich in front by finishing off a superb move. QPR levelled when Djibril Cisse's penalty was saved by John Ruddy, only for Bobby Zamora to convert the rebound, even though he had encroached into the area when the kick was struck. Russell Martin's late header hit the QPR crossbar, but neither side were able to fashion a winning goal. Both teams had a similar point to prove following respective 5-0 thumpings on the opening day of the season - away at Fulham for Norwich and at home to Swansea for QPR. The response from Canaries boss Chris Hughton was to overhaul his back line, handing debuts to new signings Sebastien Bassong and Javier Garrido, and recalling Leon Barnett for his first appearance since February. But it was a change at the other end of the pitch, with Jackson returning to partner Grant Holt up front, which proved decisive for the opening goal. An intricate series of passes on the edge of the QPR area saw the ball find its way out wide to Anthony Pilkington, who clipped in a left-footed cross which was met by the head of Jackson from point-blank range. Rangers boss Mark Hughes, who made only two changes, was equally rewarded by his decision to include Zamora alongside Cisse. When Bassong and Cisse came together in the area, referee Mark Clattenburg's decision to award a penalty looked harsh, with the striker losing control of the ball before going down. Cisse's resulting spot-kick was touched on to the post by Ruddy, only for Zamora to apply a finish to the rebound. However, the twice-capped England international had clearly encroached into the penalty area when the kick was struck, leaving the Canaries doubly aggrieved. QPR's biggest concern was Clint Hill's inability to get to grips with the power of Holt and it was no surprise that the centre-half, who had been booked for dragging down the Norwich forward, was substituted at half-time. Hill's replacement Nedum Onuoha was immediately at the centre of the action, getting in a mix-up with keeper Robert Green, who seemed to handle the ball outside the area. Neither the referee nor his assistant spotted it, however, and ex-Canaries keeper Green, returning to his former club for the first time since he left in 2006, was reprieved. QPR's most likely source of a winner was the pace of Cisse, but his constant attempts to beat the Norwich offside trap were regularly met by a raised flag. Norwich should have secured all three points, with Garrido crossing for Robert Snodgrass, who headed over, and the impressive Pilkington swinging in for Martin, who nodded on to the top of the bar.  Norwich manager Chris Hughton: "I'm quite sure their camp will say something different but it's a soft penalty. Cisse was stretching for the ball and his momentum would have taken him down anyway. "I accept Seb didn't touch the ball. The double whammy is the penalty itself. On the referee's side Bobby Zamora is at least three yards in the box which gives him an advantage. "We were hurting from last week and I expected a response. I thought we put in a performance that was worthy of a win."  QPR manager Mark Hughes: "I think the penalty decision was right. Norwich will think it's soft and I'd probably agree with that but there's definitely contact. "[On Zamora's encroachment] there were probably three of ours encroaching and four of them so I think it evens itself out. [Referee] Mark Clattenburg made the right decision there. "We showed good character after going behind. In terms of performance we know there's more to come from us."

24.04.2013 23:34:17 Wigan secured their first win of the new campaign as Southampton's first top-flight home game for seven seasons ended in disappointment. Franco di Santo rifled into the roof of the net for a Latics side without Victor Moses , whose move to Chelsea went through on Friday.  Arouna Kone then robbed Jose Fonte near the halfway line to secure the points. Saints captain Adam Lallana and defender Jos Hooiveld both hit the bar but Wigan deserved their win. The match was the Saints' first home game since their 27-year stay in the top flight was ended in May 2005. Neither side could create any notable chances in the opening stages, before England Under-21 international Lallana took things into his own hands and produced a stunning save from Ali Al Habsi as the Wigan goalkeeper used all his 6ft 4in frame to tip the 25-yard drive onto the bar. The dismal play on the pitch was soon reflected by the weather as heavy rain fell towards the end of the first half. Whatever the managers said at the interval had an immediate effect, as Rickie Lambert - who scored 27 goals in the Championship for Southampton last term - forced Al Habsi into a smart save from a header before Di Santo opened the scoring for the visitors a minute later. The Argentine ran onto an incisive through-ball by a twisting Shaun Maloney and powered his shot into the roof of Kelvin Davis's net from a tight angle. Lambert was carrying all Southampton's attacking threat and, after he forced another save from Al Habsi with a low shot from 25 yards, he turned creator as his cross was headed onto the bar by centre-back Hooiveld. Wigan's defence was torn apart by Chelsea at times last Sunday, but summer signing Ivan Ramis - so badly exposed by Eden Hazard last weekend - helped them to hold firm and keep successive away home clean sheets for the first time in a year. Moses had produced the spark in the Wigan team that lost just two of their final seven away games last season as they stylishly avoided the drop, and his absence appeared obvious for much of the game as Kone struggled to make an impact. This was to change in the final minute of normal time as the Ivorian finally showed the finishing ability that saw him score twice against La Liga champions Real Madrid for former side Levante last season as he robbed the hesitant Fonte and slotted into the net with aplomb.  Southampton manager Nigel Adkins:  "The Premier League is a relentless division. We had opportunities and didn't take them. You have to be ruthless, the harsh reality is you will be punished if you are not. "Wigan scored their two goals with good finishes and our goalkeeper Kelvin Davies had nothing else to do but pick the ball out of his net. "Goals change games, and 1-0 down with 20 minutes to go, you change your formation to get back into it; that is my responsibility. "But the 4-4-2 saw them have far too much of the ball."  Wigan manager Roberto Martinez:  "I am delighted, as we knew we were coming in the worst possible moment to play them due to their winning momentum from their achievements to get into the Premier League. They put us under massive pressure early on, and from then on we composed ourselves and slowly grew into the game. "It was a well worked performance and we had to be perfect in many aspects. "The strikers live on great finishes and scoring goals. They did huge jobs for the team, and the goals were their reward."

24.04.2013 23:34:17 Andre Villas-Boas was denied his first win as Tottenham boss as James Morrison snatched a late equaliser for West Brom at White Hart Lane. Benoit Assou-Ekotto's deflected 25-yard shot looked to have given Spurs victory with 15 minutes of the game remaining. But the Baggies refused to give in and were rewarded when Morrison stroked home from 10 yards in the last minute. It was a painful end to a frustrating afternoon for Spurs, who created more chances but were wasteful. However, Steve Clarke's side will rightly point to their growing influence on the game as evidence of this being a very deserved point. Villas-Boas can be forgiven for being sick of the sight of West Brom, who have played a significant - and largely antagonistic - role in the story of his time in England. While the Portuguese's first win as Chelsea boss came over the Baggies, it was a defeat by Albion just over six months later that proved to be the last act of his Stamford Bridge 'project'. Once again the Midlands club have thrown a spanner in the works to leave the 34-year-old with just three wins from his last 14 Premier League games. However, there were many positives that Villas-Boas and the Spurs fans - some of whom remain doubtful of his appointment - can take away from this first home game of the season. They fashioned the greater number of chances, their most potent attacking weapon, Gareth Bale, looks sharp and in Jan Vertonghen they have a centre-back who can grow into an authoritative presence in this division. Within the first 15 minutes Bale had swung over two dangerous crosses - narrowly missed by team-mates - and sliced a shot wide of goal. He also provided a superb pull-back for Belgian Vertonghen to also fire wide. This was all encouraging but what the home side needed was a goal and the longer they went without one, the more the crowd's nerves grew and West Brom increased as a presence in the match. On the evidence of the first two games of this campaign, Steve Clarke - an old colleague of Villas-Boas under Jose Mourinho at Chelsea - is building superbly on the fine work done by predecessor Roy Hodgson at the Hawthorns. Buoyed by their resilience to all that Spurs threw at them and by the introduction of Romelu Lukaku from the bench, the Baggies burst into attacking life and forced Brad Friedel into two superb saves - one from the on-loan Chelsea striker's angled shot and then from Marc-Antoine Fortune as he bundled into the box. It was just after this that Tottenham scored, as Assou-Ekotto's long-range drive deflected off Graham Dorrans' head to beat Ben Foster and seemingly give Spurs the win. However, such is the Baggies' spirit that they kept on attacking and, after hitting the bar during one mad scramble in the box, they capitalised during another, with Morrison finding space in the box to side-foot into the net after the ball had fallen invitingly at his feet. It was too late for Tottenham to respond. So Clarke's West Brom tenure remains bathed in optimism, while Villas-Boas will be glad that it is another six months before he has to face the Baggies again.

24.04.2013 23:34:17 Swansea maintained their 100% start to the Premier League season after capitalising on West Ham errors to secure an impressive win. Angel Rangel opened the scoring when his shot squirmed under the body of goalkeeper Jussi Jaaskelainen. James Collins gifted Swansea a second when his back pass fell short and let in Michu to score. West Ham offered little and Danny Graham finished off a fine move with a third in the second half. Michael Laudrup's side were well worth their victory, which took them to the top of the Premier League having scored eight goals in their opening two games. Unsurprisingly Laudrup named the same team which thrashed QPR 5-0 on the opening day of the season.  Scott Sinclair was not in the matchday squad with Swansea reported to have accepted a bid from Manchester City for the winger.   Record signing Ki Sung-Yueng was not eligible for the game but the South Korean international was introduced to the Liberty Stadium crowd before kick-off. West Ham started with new Â£10m recruit Matt Jarvis, one of two changes, along with James Tomkins, to the side that defeated Aston Villa last weekend. Jarvis was prominent as the visitors started well, but captain Kevin Nolan failed to get on the end of the former Wolves winger's inviting cross with barely two minutes gone. But the home side slowly got to grips with the game and they went ahead on 20 minutes through Rangel. Nathan Dyer found the full-back in the penalty area and the Spaniard's low drive across the face of goal squirmed under the body of Jaaskelainen and into the net. Nine minutes later Swansea doubled their lead following another West Ham mistake. Wales defender Collins's backpass to his goalkeeper fell short and striker Michu capitalised and applied the simplest of touches for his third goal of the season. West Ham had offered little, but debutant Jarvis went close for the visitors when his volley on the turn was well saved by Michel Vorm. Swansea were playing with belief and continued to push forward with left-back Neil Taylor forcing a finger tip save from Jaaskelainen after a marauding run upfield. West Ham finished a poor first half strongly and Carlton Cole, who had been largely isolated up front, had a header cleared off the line in stoppage time. Swansea's pace continued to cause problems in the second half and Graham flashed an effort wide of Jaaskelainen's left hand post after being played in by Dyer. A ferocious Jonathan de Guzman free-kick flashed across the face of the West Ham goal before Swansea scored a third on 64 minutes. Graham atoned for his earlier miss when he finished off a fine Swansea move by scoring from close range from Wayne Routledge's low cross. Home goalkeeper Vorm was rarely troubled and he comfortably dealt with substitute Ricardo Vaz Te's low free-kick. But the Hammers could do little to stop a Swansea side who have shown their early season intent under new manager Laudrup.  Swansea manager Michael Laudrup:  "It was a fantastic result. The first half we scored two goals but we suffered from West Ham's set-pieces as they have some very big guys. Second half, I think we controlled everything. "The fans always enjoy it when you win, but we have a creative style here that we have continued with some small tactical changes. We want to play like Swansea did in the last four or five years. "The situation with Scott Sinclair is that last week he came on and scored a goal, in the last two or three days there have been a few offers, and I spoke to Scott and we agreed it was better to not play. Let us see what happens in the next four or five days."  West Ham manager Sam Allardyce:  "The first half performance was looking very, very good and we were looking comfortable, but we have had two disastrous mistakes, and when you make those sort of errors, particularly away from home, it is going to be difficult to come back. "We gifted the opposition the goals and it is difficult to comeback. They have effectively won the game, and can then keep the ball. We have only ourselves to blame. "We are not negotiating to sign anybody at the moment."

24.04.2013 23:34:17 Chelsea avoided a major upset as they came from behind to overcome a brave Reading at Stamford Bridge. A Frank Lampard penalty put the home side ahead before Pavel Pogrebnyak's steered header levelled matters. Blues keeper Petr Cech fumbled a Danny Guthrie free-kick into his own net to gift Reading a shock lead. Gary Cahill's shot hauled Chelsea level and, after Fernando Torres tapped in when he appeared offside, Branislav Ivanovic got a fourth for the Blues. In such an enthralling and absorbing game, it was a shame that what appears to be a mistake by the linesman for Torres's goal played such a crucial role in the eventual result, and undid so much of Reading's good work. The Royals were on the verge of a famous upset against the European champions for much of the game and, while there was an element of fortune for Chelsea, they will see it as reward for their pressure and perseverance. And, although the victory moved them to the top of the Premier League for the first time since November 2010, there was little sign of what was to come early on when Chelsea had a classy and authoritative air about their play. They had Reading rocking and, if Ramires had squared the ball to an unmarked Torres rather than go for a left-foot shot which was saved, Chelsea might have been ahead sooner. Torres epitomised the confidence oozing through the home side when he nutmegged Jem Karacan and ghosted past a defender before his shot was diverted wide by centre-back Alex Pearce. The goal Chelsea had threatened to produce finally came when the speed and subtlety of Eden Hazard's footwork mesmerised Chris Gunter into bringing the Belgian down. Lampard smashed in the resulting penalty but, rather than Chelsea going on to overwhelm the Royals, the home side were stunned by Reading's fightback. Width was the visitors' strength and, when Garath McCleary drilled in a cross, Pogrebnyak's expert header to the far post was beyond Cech's reach. The equaliser helped the visitors grow in stature and, if Cech had little chance with Reading's opener, he was at fault for their second. Chelsea skipper John Terry cynically fouled Jobi McAnuff and Guthrie's low, driven free-kick was spilled by a sprawling Cech into his own net. Reading were showing no respect or reverence to their more illustrious hosts and a rattled home outfit might have gone further behind had an unmarked Pearce managed to get on the end of Ian Harte's diagonal free-kick. Hazard, who had two assists on his Premier League debut in the win over Wigan, has adapted quickly to the top-flight and he set up Torres for a chance the Spaniard headed disappointingly wide. Reading were holding their own but, as Chelsea exerted more pressure, the visitors eventually succumbed, although Adam Federici will feel he should have had stronger hands to palm Cahill's 25-yard shot wide. Chelsea's passing and probing helped them engineer a lead with a third goal when Ashley Cole slid the ball across for Torres to sidefoot in, although there was more than a hint of offside about his position. Ivanovic's effort came when he was set up for an easy finish by Hazard with Royals keeper Federici stranded after going up to the Chelsea end for a corner as the visitors searched for an injury-time equaliser.  Chelsea manager Roberto Di Matteo:  "It was a very entertaining game for the supporters. We started very well, certainly until they equalised which knocked us back a bit. "We kept them under pressure and luckily got the equaliser which galvanised us and we kept going forward. "I've not seen the replay [of the Torres goal]. I looked at the linesman straight away and he gave the goal. "We are very pleased with six points after two games."

24.04.2013 23:34:17 Robin van Persie started life at Manchester United with a defeat as Everton produced an outstanding performance to deservedly claim victory at Goodison Park. Sir Alex Ferguson's Â£24m signing from Arsenal emerged as a 67th-minute substitute - but he made a quiet introduction and was powerless to prevent United starting the Premier League season with a defeat - their first since they lost at Chelsea in 2004. And it was fitting that Everton's winning goal came from the outstanding Marouane Fellaini, who tormented Manchester United's makeshift defence throughout a thunderous evening on Merseyside. The giant Belgian's towering 57th minute header from Darron Gibson's corner finally ended the defiance of United keeper David de Gea, who had kept Everton at bay with a series of outstanding first half saves. Leon Osman also struck the crossbar - and when Van Persie was finally introduced Everton had an iron grip on the game and only looked like conceding the advantage Fellaini had given them when Phil Jagielka cleared off the line from Tom Cleverley. Everton have traditionally been slow starters but in this opening game they dominated United for spells, with keeper Tim Howard only being troubled by the occasional effort from Wayne Rooney. Goodison Park celebrated the victory noisily at the final whistle, leaving Ferguson to contemplate a lacklustre performance undermined by a reshuffled rearguard in which Michael Carrick never settled in his role as emergency central defender alongside returning captain Nemanja Vidic. United were without Rio Ferdinand, Phil Jones, Chris Smalling and Jonny Evans - and how Everton exploited the weakness. Ferguson eased Van Persie into life at Old Trafford with a place on the bench, entrusting attacking duties to Rooney and England youngster Danny Welbeck. United were grateful to keeper De Gea for a performance of defiance and athleticism that kept his side on terms as they were terrorised by the power and presence of Fellaini. The young Spaniard stretched to turn over Steven Pienaar's header then dived to turn away the South African's shot as Everton applied pressure. He did even better to save Osman's shot on the turn and leap to claw away a free-kick from Leighton Baines that was destined for the top corner. United had opportunities of their own but they were rarities, Howard saving twice from Rooney and Welbeck rolling a low shot wide as United claimed a penalty when he tangled with Jagielka. United's biggest escape came just after the interval when Fellaini once more headed into the path of Osman, who did beat De Gea but held his head in anguish as his effort rattled the crossbar. Everton were not to be denied and finally got the lead they so deserved. The source was no surprise as Fellaini - who had simply been too much for Carrick - rose above him to power in Gibson's corner. United gave Everton their most anxious moment after 66 minutes when Jagielka cleared off the line from Cleverley and seconds later Van Persie entered the fray in place of Welbeck. However, with Jagielka and Sylvain Distin magnificent, Everton were in no mood to see their resistance broken and they claimed a win their efforts merited.  Read Sir Alex Ferguson's post-match reaction to United's defeat.   Everton manager David Moyes: "I'm really pleased because we performed ever so well. We've often started the season slowly but just because we've won one game doesn't mean we've had a good start - as it would not have been a bad start had we lost. "Marouane Fellaini is a really good player. We can play him behind the striker, in the middle or because of his power in the air we can play him as a defensive one as well. "The only time we had a really good start here we ended in the Champions League places. I don't know if that's possible but it would be nice for us not to be playing catch up. "David de Gea made some great saves. In the build-up it was all about Manchester United and what they could do - I felt people called that wrong because we are a tough team to beat at Goodison Park. "We defended really well when we had to. Phil Jagielka was outstanding."

24.04.2013 23:34:17 Manchester City began the defence of their Premier League title in similarly dramatic fashion to that in which they won it - this time with a thrilling victory over Southampton. City secured the championship three months ago with two goals at the death to beat QPR 3-2 and once again relied on a late flurry to make sure they started the new campaign the way they finished the last. After Carlos Tevez had put City ahead, Rickie Lambert and Steven Davis replied to give the newly promoted Saints a surprise lead with only 20 minutes left. But the champions fought back to level through Edin Dzeko before Samir Nasri struck 10 minutes from time, leaving Roberto Mancini's men to hang on for a breath-taking triumph. It was clear almost from the outset that things would not be straightforward for City against a team that was playing in League One only two years ago. City lost last season's top scorer Sergio Aguero to a serious-looking knee injury after just 13 minutes and saw David Silva make a mess of a penalty moments later. Aguero scored 23 top-flight goals last season, including the dramatic injury-time strike against QPR that gave his side the title in the last minute of the last day of the campaign. The drama that followed after the Argentine striker was stretchered off against the Saints was not quite in the same bracket as that momentous afternoon in May but City's fans were still given a rollercoaster ride on their way to the three points. Aguero had gone down clutching his knee in agony after an innocuous challenge by Nathaniel Clyne and, although he got to his feet, he ended up being carried down the tunnel. City's day got worse three minutes later, with Silva seeing his penalty easily stopped by Kelvin Davis after Jos Hooiveld fouled Tevez inside the box. Southampton seemed galvanised by that Davis save and they defended stubbornly until just before the break, when Tevez beat the offside trap to squeeze home his shot inside the post. The home side created a flurry of chances at the start of the second half but Dzeko and Gael Clichy both missed the target and Silva somehow fired against the bar from close range after being set up by Nasri. Saints substitute Lambert, the top scorer in the Championship last season, punished them for their wastefulness when he drilled home a loose ball to level out of the blue just before the hour mark. If that goal was a big surprise to the home fans, they were stunned eight minutes later when Southampton swept forward from a City corner and Davis, who like Lambert had only been on the field a matter of minutes, found the bottom corner from the edge of the area. Mancini's men responded immediately, with Yaya Toure setting up Dzeko to fire home from close range and bring the City supporters back to life. That left 18 minutes for  City to find a winner, which duly arrived when Clichy's cross bounced into the path of Nasri, who found the net with a fierce drive from 10 yards out.

24.04.2013 23:34:17 Aston Villa missed the chance to pull out of the Premier League relegation zone as Liverpool came from behind to stay in the hunt for a European place. Paul Lambert's side took the lead when Gabriel Agbonlahor's lay-off found Christian Benteke, who powered home. Liverpool equalised shortly after the restart when Jordan Henderson dinked the ball past the reach of Brad Guzan. And Steven Gerrard scored the winner from the spot after Nathan Baker brought down Luis Suarez in the area. The second Liverpool goal came with 30 minutes left to play which gave the home side plenty of time to get something from the match. However, after Austrian Andreas Weimann blasted his shot horribly high over the bar and Gerrard cleared Benteke's header off the line, it seemed the omens were not on Villa's side. Boss Lambert now needs to reinvigorate his squad, who came into the match on the back of two successive league wins. This defeat leaves them on 30 points, below 17th-placed Wigan on goal difference following the Latics' win against Norwich on Saturday. Villa travel to Stoke next week before facing Manchester United and fellow strugglers Sunderland in what will be a crucial month in the future of the club. It could have been a very different result for the Birmingham outfit had they not been so profligate in front on goal in the opening quarter of the match. Almost straight from the kick-off Joe Bennett, in for the injured Ciaran Clark, delivered a sumptuous ball from the left that both Benteke and Agbonlahor failed to connect with from six yards out. Moments later, Matthew Lowton swung in a cross from the other wing which this time found Agbonlahor, who wasted a golden chance by firing straight at Reina. They eventually took the lead when Ashley Westwood played a quarter-back pass into the path of Agbonlahor, who used his thigh to lay the ball into the path of Benteke. The Belgian, one of Villa's key performers this season, gave Pepe Reina no chance with his finish. However, the half could have finished 3-3. Liverpool playmaker Suarez had two great chances - a shot that was tipped over by Brad Guzan and three that were easily saved when he was one-on-one with the Villa goalkeeper. The United States international also came to the rescue when he punched a Gerrard drive clear that was destined for the top corner. But he was helpless to stop the equaliser which came two minutes after the break. This time Gerrard found Philippe Coutinho with a long punt downfield. The Brazilian midfielder threaded a precise ball through to Henderson, who lifted his shot past Guzan. It was an excellent move and finish. Liverpool were in the ascendancy and Coutinho should have added another when he was put through by Suarez, while full-back Glen Johnson saw his strike come off a Villa player and rebound back off the far post. The home side were holding on until the hour mark when Baker, who came through the Villa ranks, scythed down Suarez. Referee Lee Mason pointed straight to the spot - there were few protestations. Gerrard stepped up and struck the ball low past Guzan. More chances came Villa's way, but Weimann was wasteful when Yacouba Sylla found him with a ball from the right before Gerrard produced one of the best goalline clearances of the season when he nodded away Benteke's powerful header.  Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers:  "We played reasonably well in the first half but we were punished for a mistake. We upped the tempo after the break and we were excellent. It is a terrific win for us. Both teams went right to the end. "Our quality was there for all to see, and the rhythm and flow of our passing was improved. "Villa went to a diamond and we exploited the space out wide. Coutinho's pass for the Henderson goal was superb, and Henderson's determination and desire to make the run was outstanding."

24.04.2013 23:34:17 Eden Hazard made an impressive Premier League debut for Chelsea as they held off a tenacious Wigan side to win 2-0. The Belgian midfielder turned neatly before sending Branislav Ivanovic clear to sidefoot in the first. Hazard was then felled for the penalty which allowed Frank Lampard to double Chelsea's lead after just six minutes. But Wigan's Victor Moses twice tested Chelsea keeper Petr Cech while Jordi Gomez headed one chance off target before screwing a volley wide late on. Moses started for the Latics despite manager Roberto Martinez suggesting that his 21-year-old striker could be unsettled by ongoing speculation linking him with a move to Chelsea.  The Nigerian, who scored six goals last season, produced a terrific performance to show why Wigan value him at Â£8.5m and why Chelsea are interested in acquiring him. He teased and beat England left-back Ashley Cole on numerous occasions in the first half, switching wings to do the same to Ivanovic in the second. However, by that point, Chelsea were already 2-0 in front with Hazard, who linked up well with Lampard and produced several neat touches before he was substituted midway through the second half,  heavily involved in both goals. His first telling contribution was to collect a pass from Lampard in the centre circle and sharply spin away from Ivan Ramis before playing a straightforward through-ball into the path of Ivanovic. The Serbian then strolled into the penalty box and beat Ali Al Habsi at his near post with a low shot. Wigan debutant Ramis's afternoon took another turn for the worse when he clumsily lunged at Hazard to give away a penalty, which Lampard fired low under Al Habsi's dive. But any thoughts that Chelsea may replicate their 6-0 victory over Wigan at the DW Stadium in 2010 were quickly extinguished. Hazard's reward was to be clattered from behind by Gary Caldwell, a vicious tackle that earned the Wigan captain a yellow card. The incident seemed to rouse Wigan though, and they went on to dominate large chunks of play and more than matched Chelsea with Maynor Figueroa, Emmerson Boyce and Moses at the centre of their better work. However, they created few clear-cut chances and their tactic of sending a barrage of crosses into the Chelsea box failed to unsettle experienced centre-backs David Luiz and John Terry. Second-half substitutes Gomez and Arouna Kone added impetus for the Latics, the former seeing a deflected free-kick well saved by Cech while Ivorian Kone headed narrowly wide. But the goal Wigan's endeavours deserved failed to materialise and they were indebted to Ramis for keeping the deficit at two when he atoned to a degree for his earlier failings by clearing a Fernando Torres effort off the line. It would have been easy for Torres to go down looking for a penalty under Ramis's initial challenge but to the striker's credit he toe-poked the ball beyond Al Habsi while stumbling forward, only to see his fellow Spaniard scamper back and knock the ball to safety.

24.04.2013 23:34:17 Hatem Ben Arfa's penalty gave Newcastle an opening-day victory and ensured Andre Villas-Boas began his tenure as Tottenham manager with defeat. Spurs hit the woodwork twice before Demba Ba put Newcastle ahead with a wonderful curling strike. Jermain Defoe levelled from close range after Magpies boss Alan Pardew was sent to the stands for shoving a linesman.  But Ben Arfa won it from the spot after he was fouled by Aaron Lennon, picking himself up to slot past Brad Friedel. A trip to the north east always looked a tricky start for Villas-Boas, against a Newcastle side aiming to build on their fifth-place finish last time out. The Magpies were last season's surprise package but this time it is Spurs who are the unknown quantity, beginning life under a new manager who is rebuilding his reputation after his ill-fated stint at Chelsea and still constructing his squad. That process will continue if and when Luka Modric leaves for Real Madrid before the end of the month and, on this evidence, Villas-Boas will surely intensify his efforts to sign Manchester City striker Emmanuel Adebayor to bolster his attacking options. Spurs had the better of the first half, new signing Gylfi Sigurdsson denied by Tim Krul - although the Â£8m Iceland midfielder did not know he had already been wrongly ruled offside. More opportunities followed before the break, with Defoe cutting into the area to prod a shot against the post, before Bale met Lennon's enticing cross with a header that looped back off the bar. But Spurs could not make their chances count while, in contrast, Newcastle put away their first opening of note nine minutes after the break. Kyle Walker failed to deal with Danny Simpson's cross and his header fell at the feet of Ba, who turned to curl home an unstoppable shot and end his run of 14 games without a goal. The Magpies had Pardew sent off soon afterwards, the Newcastle boss pushing linesman Peter Kirkup after claiming the ball had gone out of play in the build-up to a Sigurdsson shot that flew wide. And Pardew soon had more to get angry about from his vantage point high in the stands. Defoe saw his header from a Lennon cross hit Davide Santon before being scrambled on to the post by Krul, but, with the Newcastle defence static, he reacted quickest to fire home the loose ball. Spurs were level for less than five minutes, however, as Ben Arfa delivered a timely reminder of what he is capable of when given space in the final third. He burst into the area and, after being brought down by a combination of mis-timed challenges by Rafael van der Vaart and Lennon, sent Friedel the wrong way from the spot. There was no way back from there for Tottenham, who only had teenager Harry Kane in the way of strikers to bring on from the bench and did not come close to salvaging a point in the final 10 minutes.

24.04.2013 23:34:17 Arsenal could not find a way past a resolute Sunderland defence as they began life without Robin van Persie with a goalless draw. Van Persie's replacements Lukas Podolski and Olivier Giroud failed to score on their debuts with substitute Giroud off target from 12 yards. Abou Diaby also had a fine first-half shot saved by Simon Mignolet. But other than an impressive debut for Santi Cazorla, it was a frustrating afternoon for the Gunners. As profligate as Arsenal were, credit must also go to Sunderland, who were tireless in closing down space on a sweltering afternoon in north London. First-half opportunities for Podolski, Cazorla, Diaby and Theo Walcott must have left the watching supporters wondering what might have been had their top scorer from last season been on the pitch. However, other than their inaccuracy, there were signs that the new signings could prove astute purchases given more time to integrate into the side. Sunderland threatened before the break when first James McClean and then Jack Colback went close to spoiling Arsenal's new dawn even further, but boss Martin O'Neill will be pleased with a point as his team stuck to a strict game plan. The Black Cats played with just Stephane Sessegnon up front, and once McClean had given Wojciech Szczesny an early wake-up call, they were quick to retreat with Lee Cattermole typically tigerish in midfield. Despite the Sunderland skipper's attentions, it was clear Cazorla was having no trouble in getting up to Premier League speed as he foraged behind fellow debutant Podolski. The former Malaga midfielder shot wide early on, and showed his full repertoire of skills when he threaded a pass to Walcott but Podolski could not turn in the winger's cut-back as Kieran Richardson closed in. Diaby shot from the edge of the box as Arsenal pushed Sunderland further back, and only isolated efforts from Colback gave the Gunners defence anything to concern them.  On the day agreement with Barcelona for the sale of Alex Song was confirmed, the midfield trio of Diaby, Cazorla and Mikel Arteta linked well and showed there is plenty of depth in that department, given Aaron Ramsey only started on the bench and Jack Wilshere is still to return from injury. Try as they might, though, they could not fashion many clear-cut openings after the break, with the Sunderland defence quick to close any gaps on the edge of the penalty area. Podolski was replaced by fellow new signing Giroud after the hour mark, with Ramsey and the returning Andrey Arshavin also introduced. Then just when it appeared the Gunners might finally make a breakthrough, Cazorla set up former Montpellier forward Giroud but his shot wide summed up the hosts' afternoon.

24.04.2013 23:34:17 Mladen Petric scored twice on his debut as Fulham crushed Norwich 5-0 on the first day of the Premier League season. The Croatian striker headed in a Damien Duff corner and scored with a 25-yard effort that deflected in off City defender Michael Turner. Duff poked in the first from 12 yards after latching onto John Arne Riise's through ball while Alex Kacaniklic tucked in the fourth from close range. Steve Sidwell smashed in a late penalty after Hugo Rodellaga was bundled over. The Cottagers bossed the match almost from the opening whistle with their quick, neat passing game leaving Norwich chasing shadows on a gloriously sunny day in west London. Moussa Dembele and Bryan Ruiz were at the centre of much of Fulham's better work, controlling the middle of the pitch and feeding Duff down the right and Riise the left. However, it took 18 minutes for the home side to have their first shot on goal and that came from a Norwich mistake - goalkeeper John Ruddy screwing a clearance straight at Ruiz but the Costa Rican's lobbed effort sailed over the crossbar. Spurred on by the chance, Fulham created three of their own in quick succession but Ruddy was equal to each, showing why he won his first England cap in the midweek 2-1 friendly win over Italy. Firstly, he was down smartly to keep out Riise's low drive, before gathering a tamer 20-yard Ruiz shot and palming a sharp Petric effort round the post. The Fulham goal that looked so likely eventually came when Riise pinged a beautiful 60-yard crossfield pass to Duff and although Ruddy managed to get his right foot on the goal-bound shot, the ball spun into the net. Petric doubled the lead before half-time, nodding in Duff's corner, to score his first goal for the Cottagers - assistant referee Charles Breakspear correctly ruling that the ball had crossed the line despite Jonny Howson's attempted clearance. New Norwich manager Chris Hughton brought on Steve Morison at the start of the second half to give lone forward Grant Holt some support but with Fulham continuing to boss the midfield, they were getting little service. Indeed it was Fulham who further extended their lead when a neat passing triangle involving Ruiz and Petric saw the latter find space 25 yards from goal and his left-foot effort deflected off Turner to leave Ruddy wrong-footed. If the third goal had an element of fortune about it, the fourth was delightfully crafted with Petric flicking a Dembele pass into the path of Kacaniklic and the Swede neatly slotted the ball past Ruddy. Petric was immediately substituted to a standing ovation and, with the game won, Duff was afforded the same accolade by manager Martin Jol. Bradley Johnson's 25-yard drive was a rare highlight for the visiting fans but Fulham keeper Mark Schwarzer kept the shot out with his knees. With Norwich fans already beginning to drift away, Rodellaga was felled by Turner and Sidwell converted the penalty as Fulham maintained their record of never having lost a home Premier League game on the opening day of the season.

24.04.2013 23:34:17 Michu and Nathan Dyer both scored twice to help Michael Laudrup get off to a dream start as Swansea boss with a thumping victory over QPR. A disastrous defensive display by Rangers began when Rob Green could not stop Michu's speculative 25-yard shot. Swansea hit the bar twice before Michu curled home his second after the break. QPR crumbled completely by the end, with Nathan Dyer scoring twice in quick succession before Scott Sinclair completed the rout with a low finish. The Welsh side put on a passing performance reminiscent of their best form under previous boss Brendan Rodgers, in what will go down as a perfect Premier League bow for their new Danish manager. The result would have been particularly sweet for Swansea fans, with Rodgers's new team Liverpool losing 3-0 to West Bromwich Albion.  For QPR fans, the day was a horrific case of deja vu as they saw their side collapse to a comprehensive opening-day defeat against Bolton at Loftus Road last August.  Things were meant to be different this time, with Rangers boss Mark Hughes fielding a raft of summer signings and promising there would be no repeat of last season's relegation struggle, which his side only just survived. But a new-look Rangers kicked off the new campaign with the same sort of defending that haunted their first season back in the top flight, starting with Green's gaffe eight minutes into his debut. The former West Ham keeper got his hand to Michu's low first-time effort from the edge of the area but could only help it into the bottom corner. The hosts initially responded well and were only denied an immediate equaliser by a superb reaction stop from Michel Vorm to keep out Jamie Mackie's close-range effort, Adel Taarabt's pass having ricocheted into his path. Another QPR new-boy Junior Hoilett cut in from the left-hand side to fire a rasping shot wide before Vorm pushed away a fierce Taarabt effort that was heading for the bottom corner. Swansea were undoubtedly on the back foot as half-time approached but their travelling supporters saw signs of what was to come when Chico and then Michu hit the bar from corners. Eight minutes into the second half, Rangers were again found wanting at the back when Wayne Routledge broke forward and set up Michu to expertly bend the ball into the top corner. Another counter-attack saw Routledge tee up Dyer to make it 3-0 and the home defence was nowhere to be seen when Dyer met a lobbed pass from substitute Kemy Agustien to make it four. By now, Laudrup was assured of a victory in his first competitive game in charge, but Sinclair added further gloss with his late strike. The former Chelsea winger, who has rejected a new contract and appears set to leave the Swans, came off the bench to smash a low shot past the beleaguered Green from the edge of the area.

24.04.2013 23:34:17 Adam Le Fondre scored a late penalty as Reading marked their Premier League return after a four-season absence with a battling draw against Stoke. Le Fondre calmly found the corner after Dean Whitehead was given a second yellow card for a foul on substitute Garath McCleary. Royals keeper Adam Federici had gifted Stoke the lead when he made a terrible mess of a Michael Kightly shot. Reading's Ian Harte nearly stole the points but his free-kick went over. A home winner would have been cruel on Stoke who were the better side for much of the game, but the Royals will feel they deserved a draw for a frantic finale that saw them pile forward in the last 10 minutes. The most relieved man on the pitch was Federici, who somehow allowed Kightly's mis-kicked first-half shot to trickle through his stooping attempted save at the near-post. For summer-signing Kightly it was a wonderful moment after two injury-blighted seasons. But the normally reliable Federici, who kept 20 clean sheets for the Championship winners last season, will know it was his horrendous howler that almost ruined Reading's top-flight return. With testing games at Chelsea and Sunderland next for Reading, the visit of a Stoke side who struggled at the end of the last campaign, and whose summer transfer activity had been limited, offered them a decent chance to get their season off to a winning start. But the Potters showed just why they have become the benchmark for newly promoted teams with a solid, professional display. Reading had the better of a cagey opening 25 minutes in which they edged both possession and territory, but they barely threatened the Stoke goal until the latter stages. Stoke defender Robert Huth, who played despite spending most of last week in hospital with viral meningitis, had a couple of nervy moments but both he and his team soon settled. Maybe the visitors were even more mindful of the need to pick up early-season points with Arsenal, Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester United to play in five of their next six games. Huth and his fellow Stoke defenders kept Reading's big summer signing Pavel Pogrebnyak quiet, and the home side's only attempts on goal before the break saw Kaspars Gorkss send a header well wide and Le Fondre fail to connect with a teasing cross. Visiting striker Jonathan Walters provided Stoke's greatest threat throughout and almost opened the scoring with a clever near-post header that went narrowly wide from a Kightly free-kick. Kightly's strike then put Stoke in control and they started to get on top, creating several chances but nothing clearcut. But Reading, cheered on by wealthy new owner Anton Zingarevich, persevered and were lifted by the introduction of substitutes Noel Hunt and McCleary. And they were rewarded for an energetic end to a match played in scorching heat when Le Fondre slotted his 89th-minute spot-kick past Asmir Begovic.  Reading manager Brian McDermott:  "Psychologically, it's important we got that result. We know we can compete and we've done that. There's no doubt about that so it's important to get a result and we have. "We'd have been disappointed to have lost the game over the 90 minutes. Those of you who have seen Reading play over the last three years know that they keep going. "We all make errors. I make errors most days. Adam Federici is a great character, who works really, really hard each and every day. He's a top professional and he's saved us many, many times, and he will do in the future. "He was upset but that's part of life. You have to overcome your disappointments quickly and he'll do that."  Stoke manager Tony Pulis:  "We are disappointed because we had opportunities to get another goal. "It is always difficult coming to a newly promoted side but it was solid performance. "It's lovely for Michael Kightly, and Robert Huth was excellent - I don't know what they feed them in Germany. "His recovery was amazing. He has trained all week and was brilliant today. We're very, very pleased to have him back and he's got a heart the size of a lion."

24.04.2013 23:34:17 Brendan Rodgers's first Premier League game as Liverpool manager turned into a nightmare as West Bromwich Albion inflicted a heavy defeat on his side at The Hawthorns. On this evidence Rodgers faces a massive task to restore Liverpool to the game's elite after succeeding the sacked Kenny Dalglish. In sharp contrast, there was delight for new Albion boss Steve Clarke - sacked along with Dalglish in Liverpool's end of season clear-out - as he watched them produce a display bristling with energy and enterprise. Zoltan Gera's spectacular strike gave Albion the lead just before half-time - then Shane Long wasted the opportunity to add a second with a weak penalty after he was brought down in the incident that led to Daniel Agger receiving a red card. Albion were not to be denied and Peter Odemwingie made no mistake from the spot after Martin Skrtel fouled Long to settle the destination of the points. Liverpool were in tatters at this point, with substitute Romelu Lukaku, on loan from Chelsea, adding a third and Albion missing further chances to give the scoreline an even more emphatic appearance. It was a brutal wake-up call for Rodgers after so much optimism surrounded the build-up to this opener. Liverpool's demise will not have the former Swansea manager sounding the alarm bells - particularly as his new charges were guilty of over-generosity in front of goal before Gera's wonder strike gave Albion such momentum. It also wouldn't have helped that his former club opened the season with a 5-0 victory over Queens Park Rangers under new manager Michael Laudrup. Rodgers gave debuts to Â£26m-worth of summer signings in the shape of Joe Allen and Fabio Borini - but both were anonymous as Liverpool gave off the distinct whiff of a team and club entering a period of transition. Liverpool had plenty of the ball and plenty of opportunities in the first 45 minutes but were undermined by a failing that troubled them throughout last season, namely an inability to convert the presentable chances they created. Luis Suarez was so sharp as Liverpool's main threat, twice forcing saves from Albion keeper Ben Foster and heading Glen Johnson's cross wide of goal when the Uruguayan should have given his side the advantage. Johnson was also wasteful when he shot off target, and an Albion side that was bursting with running and ideas made them pay when they went ahead in stunning fashion as the interval approached. Liverpool could only partially clear James Morrison's corner, giving Gera the opening to lash a magnificent rising drive past the helpless Pepe Reina from 25 yards. Suarez's frustrations then got the better of him as he was shown a yellow card by referee Phil Dowd after gesturing angrily in the direction of an assistant following an offside decision. Albion had the opportunity to double their lead on the hour when referee Dowd awarded a penalty when Long tumbled as he tangled with Agger. The Danish defender disputed the decision and his anger only increased when he was shown the red card. Reina almost had to wait to receive Long's awful penalty - but Liverpool failed to cash in on the escape as Albion were awarded another spot-kick. Liverpool again contested the award as Skrtel upended Long after being caught in possession. Odemwingie took penalty responsibilities from Long and drilled Albion's second past Reina. The numerical advantage was leaving space to exploit and Albion should have used it to add a third when Lukaku brushed substitute Jamie Carragher away from possession with embarrassing ease. The striker squared for Morrison who took aim, only to shoot off target. The powerful Lukaku was already causing problems for Liverpool's defence and he added the third with 13 minutes left, rising at the far post to meet Liam Ridgewell's cross with a simple far-post header. After that it was damage limitation for Liverpool - not the state of affairs Rodgers envisaged as the opener to his managerial reign.

24.04.2013 23:34:17 West Ham marked their Premier League return with a win over Aston Villa, who were beaten in new manager Paul Lambert's first game in charge. The Hammers went ahead when Ricardo Vaz Te pulled the ball across for Kevin Nolan to sidefoot home. West Ham later had a penalty shout for a shove by Villa centre-back Ron Vlaar on striker Carlton Cole waved away. Villa rarely troubled their hosts and Cole should have extended West Ham's lead but headed wide from close range. Hammers substitute Modibo Maiga also came close in injury-time when he raced clear and rounded keeper Shay Given only to see his shot cleared from the goalmouth by backtracking defender Nathan Baker. The miss did not prove crucial against a Villa side who started brightly but ultimately showed little improvement on the side that only avoided relegation by two points last season. In contrast, West Ham's victory served to continue the feelgood factor around east London after London 2012. The shadow of the Olympic Stadium - the Hammers' prospective new home - looms large over Upton Park and could yet provide inspiration in a campaign where Premier League safety remains the first target. However, the home side began in a subdued and stuttering fashion, with Villa - in particular, central midfielder Fabian Delph - possessing the greater enterprise. Lambert has promised Villa fans more of an attacking style but, while his side showed intent, they could not find the incisiveness to pierce the Hammers defence. West Ham gradually shook off their apprehension and started to pose more of a threat, with the strength of striker Cole unsettling Villa's summer signing Vlaar. Nolan fizzed an 18-yard free-kick just wide after a foul by Vlaar on Cole before the Hammers breakthrough. A floated Mark Noble free-kick was headed on to Vaz Te and he squared the ball for Nolan to provide the finishing touch. The assistant's flag had gone up for offside against Vaz Te but referee Mike Dean awarded the goal after correctly ruling that Villa's Ciaran Clark had headed the ball on and not West Ham's James Collins. Vlaar was being given a testing workout on his Premier League debut and cut a relieved figure when referee Dean waved away West Ham's penalty appeals for a shove on Cole. A Vlaar shot, saved by Hammers keeper Jussi Jaaskelainen, was Villa's only real effort on target as they surrendered tamely to defeat.  West Ham boss Sam Allardyce:  "We grew into the game. We started to expose Aston Villa's defence and got the goal with a perfectly good goal and a perfectly good decision with the referee overruling the linesman. "I think there was a definite penalty on Carlton Cole after half-time. "It ended up as a very good day as we won 1-0 and kept a clean sheet. James Collins was back and solid in defence which gave us a platform to win the game and there were lots of good performances."  Aston Villa manager Paul Lambert:  "We started the game really well but we just never really created as much as we wanted to. "I couldn't fault the effort. We will pick ourselves up and go again. There is a long way to go and we'll see what happens. "I have great belief in [the players]. They will do fine. If we can stick together and the fans stick with us we'll be OK."

24.04.2013 23:34:17 Manchester United's Ryan Giggs has been hailed by Uefa president Michel Platini for staying loyal to the Old Trafford club. Giggs was in the Manchester United team which secured the Premier League title with a 3-0 victory over Aston Villa.  United have now won the Premier League 13 times and Giggs has featured in all of their title winning campaigns. "He's a guy who would never change clubs," Platini said of the Welshman. Giggs played a prominent role in United's win over Villa which clinched the title, setting up two of Robin van Persie's three goals. Cardiff-born Giggs has spent his entire career with Manchester United since making his first team debut as a 17-year-old in 1991. The 39-year-old made his 1,000th senior appearance this season and signed a new one-year contract with United in March.  And Uefa president Platini, the former French national team captain,  says Giggs' loyalty is much admired in today's modern game. "That is beautiful. I like the people that fight for their colours and don't change [clubs] every two months to make business," Platini added. "To make business you have to change clubs often. It's a pity we change, change, change but I know why we change. "It's not because to be at better clubs it's to have better money. Ryan Giggs is totally different. "It's important to create an identity and it's important that one guy for one club fights for the colours."

24.04.2013 23:34:17 Sir Alex Ferguson says Robin van Persie has had "as big an impact as anyone" he can remember at Manchester United after helping them win the Premier League. The Dutchman, 29, scored a hat-trick in Monday's 3-0 win over Aston Villa that secured United's 20th league title. He has hit 24 league goals since moving from Arsenal for Â£24m last summer. United boss Ferguson said: "I remember Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger saying to me 'he's better than you think' when we concluded the deal. He was right." Earlier this season, Manchester City boss Roberto Mancini said his failure to buy Van Persie was the difference between the two teams in the title race. And, when asked after the Villa game where he ranks Van Persie in terms of the best signings he has made during his 26 years in charge of United, Ferguson replied "He has made a fantastic contribution. "In terms of impact he has had as big an impact as anyone I can imagine. "Eric Cantona was an incredible impact player and I have been very, very lucky in that I have had some fantastic strikers right through, probably 10 great strikers at the club. "I think we had an expectation of Robin because his performance last year for Arsenal was sensational. We saw him last year and knew he could gel into the way our team was, and he has never disappointed us. Ferguson called Van Persie's left-foot volley that put United 2-0 up on the night, the "goal of the century". The Scot added: "It was a marvellous hit, head down, over the ball, perfect timing - a magnificent strike. "Of all the great goals we've scored over the years, from David Beckham through Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Eric Cantona, that goal has joined that. "He's been unbelievable. His early form in the first six months was fantastic. He had the spell where he didn't score but he was unbelievable against Villa." Ferguson also praised some of his younger players after securing his 13th Premier League crown, and says he is confident his whole team will be even stronger next year. "The nucleus of the side is young enough," he added. "We expect them to improve. "This season we saw an incredible improvement from Rafael. The impetuosity has left him and he is playing with great maturity now. David De Gea has developed fantastically well too. "And I think Phil Jones is one of the best players we have ever had, no matter where we play him. "He has got such fantastic influence no matter where he plays, and has such an instinct for the game and a drive about him. At 21, I think he is going to be a phenomenal player - I have no idea what his best position is , because he can play anywhere on the pitch." United are 16 points clear of deposed champions City with four games to play and, as well as chasing a Premier League record tally of 96 points - Chelsea accumulated 95 in the 2004-05 season -  they could break the record for the biggest margin of victory in the top flight, which they set themselves when they took the title by 18 points in 1999/2000. Because of the manner of their success, Ferguson does not think it will be long until his current team earn the same admiration as some of his great sides of the past. "It must, it must," he insisted. "I am trying to think of a player who scored a goal like Van Persie's against Villa, that's one example. These players have joined the pedestal. "I think Rafael will eventually be compared to Gary Neville. Jones, Jonny Evans, Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic are without a doubt as good as all the centre-backs we have had. I am not saying they are better. "When you do compare them, then obviously we have had some fantastic players in the past and I am not trying to minimise their impact on the club, but great players are great players and the nostalgia thing does play tricks with your mind."

24.04.2013 23:34:17 Kevin Mirallas's stunning solo goal maintained Everton's hopes of European qualification, while pushing Stoke closer to the drop zone. A laboured contest at Goodison Park was lifted when the winger countered from inside his own half before slotting calmly past goalkeeper Asmir Begovic. Prior to that, Stoke's Jonathan Walters had hit the crossbar from close-range. Stoke then threatened in the air after the interval but could not find a way past the hosts' solid defence. Everton have been around the top-five all season, but their bid to return to European competition for the first time since 2009-10 has been hampered by the 12 draws they had registered in the Premier League.  Mirallas's impressive effort meant they closed to four points outside the final Champions League spot after Chelsea's surprise 2-1 defeat at Southampton, while keeping pace with Arsenal, who remain two points ahead in the Europa League qualification position after their 4-1 thrashing of Reading.  With tricky away trips to Tottenham, Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea to come, it was vital the Toffees overturned Tony Pulis's struggling Stoke side, who are now four points above 18th-placed Aston Villa after claiming just one win in their last 12 top flight fixtures.  Despite this wretched run of form, Stoke could have scored only a 10th away league strike in the opening minutes when Walters tapped onto the woodwork from five yards after Tim Howard did well to push out a Robert Huth header. Everton slowly began to edge the physical battle, and should have gone ahead when striker Nikola Jelavic, who has only scored one league goal in 2013, headed straight at Begovic after Stoke failed to clear their lines. An uninspired match then came to life when Mirallas beat Steven Nzonzi to Howard's punch from a Stoke corner, danced past his retreating opponents at pace, and effortlessly tucked the ball in for his sixth goal in an injury-hampered first season on Merseyside.  The visitors were the first side to threaten in a dull opening after the interval, but defender Huth glanced Glenn Whelan's inswinging free-kick wide as he failed to properly connect with the ball at the back-post. Everton were warned again when Ryan Shotton spurned the chance to get his second Premier League goal as he headed over Sylvain Distin's stretched clearance while unmarked. Jolted into life, David Moyes's men picked up the pace once more and went close with two threatening quick-fire free-kicks on the edge of the Stoke penalty area from specialist Leighton Baines and striker Jelavic. With returning defender Phil Jagielka at the fore, the Toffees then professionally saw out the final stages to claim a victory that left them dreaming of Europe and their opponents dreading a relegation fight.  Stoke manager Tony Pulis:  "You cannot blame the players. Their attitude and application has been absolutely first class. "It is our fifth year in the Premier League, and it is our best in terms of performances away from home, we just have not got the results. It is a strange game in lots of respects but we have to keep on believing. "It is difficult times, but it is times you get paid for. I thought we played some smashing football today, and we do not get credit at times for the football we play."

24.04.2013 23:34:17 Sir Alex Ferguson says his Manchester United players "came up trumps" by battling back from last season's disappointment to claim a 20th title. Manchester City denied United another Premier League crown on the final day of last season, but Monday's 3-0 win over Aston Villa earned the Old Trafford club a remarkable 13th title in 21 seasons. "They focused on the challenge of City and came up trumps," said Ferguson. "Our consistency for the last 20 years is unbelievable." The win over struggling Aston Villa, inspired by Robin van Persie's hat-trick, handed United the points they required to wrap up the league with four games to spare. It made up for the despair of last May, when Ferguson's side were denied the title by City on goal difference. "This club never gives in," the Scot, 71, added. "From Sir Matt Busby, the Munich Disaster, to rebuilding and to win the European Cup, that tells you the history of United. "Every player who comes to this club has to have that engrained. We have lived up to the expectation. "What the players had to do was focus on how we lost the league last year and make no mistakes. The focus was good. "The one thing I said to them was don't lose on inferior goal difference. We'd never had that before at this club and this season we have corrected that." Asked if his current squad was the best of his 26-year reign at Old Trafford, Ferguson responded: "This could arguably be. There is a lot of youth and a lot will get better, we expect that. "It is sweet, it doesn't matter when you win the title, the consistency has been phenomenal." United are 16 points clear of nearest rivals City and could finish the campaign with a record-breaking 96, eclipsing the Premier League points total of 95 set by Jose Mourinho's Chelsea side in 2004-05. United's four remaining games are against Arsenal, Chelsea, Swansea and West Brom. But even on their way to the title, Ferguson's team have had to face the criticism that they lack the quality of United teams of the recent past. "It's dead easy to say that, nostalgia plays tricks on people's minds," said Ferguson. "Put it in context, we've now got 84 points with four games left. We've never done that." On City's title failure, Ferguson added: "The games between the two of us there was nothing in it, but in the rest of them we were far better. "We were a far better team than Man City in beating other teams." Van Persie's second goal against relegation-threatened Villa - a left-foot volley hit first time from Wayne Rooney's 35-yard pass - was singled out for particular praise by Ferguson. "All the great goals we've scored over the years, from David Beckham through Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Eric Cantona, that goal has joined that," said the manager. "Robin has been unbelievable. Tonight he was unstoppable. The second goal reminded me of myself, but I can't remember when! "He scored exactly the same goal for Arsenal." On Ryan Giggs securing a 13th Premier League title, Ferguson added: "Deary me, he is a freak, a unique freak. A phenomenal man. We are lucky to have him and Paul Scholes, you are blessed as a manager. "You have to look at how lucky you have been and that I have been. Other ingredients come into it but I am lucky to have them."

24.04.2013 23:34:17 Robin van Persie says his first Premier League trophy was worth the wait as the striker's hat-trick against Aston Villa sealed a 20th top-flight title for Manchester United. The Netherlands international, 29, scored three first-half goals in United's 3-0 win on Monday. It ended a wait of almost a decade for Van Persie, who did not win the Premier League in eight years at Arsenal. "I had to wait so long for my first title. It is a great feeling," he said. "This is a fantastic team and fantastic players. It is a championship for every single one of them. The staff, the managers, the physios. "This is our 20th title, it is deserved." Full-back Patrice Evra , 31, felt United's success was all the sweeter after their final-day heartache last season, when Sergio Aguero's late winner against Queens Park Rangers gave the title to Manchester City. "It is unbelievable," said Evra. "It was really important to get back that trophy because I remember last year when we lost and people said Manchester City would take control. "I said then that when Manchester United got back their consistency they would finish 10 points clear, I was wrong because now it is 16." Veteran midfielder Ryan Giggs helped United win their first title of the Premier League era in 1993. The 39-year-old has now won his 13th title with the club, and he said: "Every one is special because you work hard in the season and especially after the disappointment of last year. "Nights like this one drive us. You want to feel like you do now, you want to see Old Trafford bouncing and that is what spurs me on. "I am lucky enough to have played under the greatest manager that has ever lived and he drives everyone on. I just want to go on as long as I am enjoying it." United striker Wayne Rooney, 27, who set up Van Persie's second against Villa, said: "We won this game in the first half and it is a fantastic night for us. "When you lose the title, it is hard to take. It wasn't a nice feeling last time. We have all dug in deep and done fantastic to put ourselves in this position. "You can never take anything for granted in football and thankfully it is now done. The manager has great desire and a winning mentality. We all buy into that and want to do well for the club. "It has been a great season for me. We have won the league title, that is what you play for." Midfielder Michael Carrick , 31, added: "The league wasn't won [on Monday night], it was won all season with all the work we have put in."

24.04.2013 23:34:17 Aston Villa boss Paul Lambert says his relegation-threatened side "must win" next week's crunch match against fellow strugglers Sunderland. Monday's defeat by Manchester United left Villa three points above the drop zone with four games left, three points below the Black Cats. "We've got to win it," Lambert said. "Sunderland are going well themselves but it is an opportunity for us. "We are at home. We know what we have to do and that's a good thing." Villa were beaten by a first-half Robin van Persie hat-trick at Old Trafford in a game that saw United crowned Premier League champions. Lambert's side remain in trouble at the other end of the table but he felt their second-half display showed the progress they are making and feels they are capable of scoring enough goals to stay up. "It was important we did not capitulate, like we did at Stamford Bridge [when Villa lost 8-0 to Chelsea in December]. "When the third goal went in I was thinking this could be a long night but I could not fault the players at all for the way they kept going. "We made some really good chances and the attacking players we have got are a definite threat. If we can keep everyone fit and healthy then we will cause teams problems. "We are getting better and I still think so many things will happen between now and the end of the season in that little group of teams at the bottom of the table. "We have got a massive game on Monday night and we have to try and win it."

24.04.2013 23:34:18 Arsenal maintained their push for a top-four finish with a comfortable victory that sent Reading bottom of the Premier League on goal difference. Gervinho opened the scoring with a close-range finish from Santi Cazorla's cross-come-shot as Arsenal dominated. Cazorla curled in after half-time before Olivier Giroud drilled a third. Reading reduced the deficit through Hal Robson-Kanu's header, but Mikel Arteta secured the points with a penalty after a foul on Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. Arsenal had many more chances to increase their advantage, but the result was never in doubt. They stay fifth in the table but are now just two points behind fourth-placed Chelsea, who were beaten at Southampton, and four behind third-placed Tottenham, over whom the resurgent Gunners have a game in hand. Arsene Wenger's side have won five of their last six Premier League games and their confidence was apparent against a Reading side who would have done little to impress their new manager Nigel Adkins. The Royals host Adkins' former club Southampton next Saturday, with their chances of avoiding relegation looking increasingly slim given they are seven points from safety with seven games remaining. Reading have conceded 61 goals this season, more than any other top-flight team, and are owners of the division's worst away record with just one win, two draws and 13 defeats. They have now lost three times to Arsenal in all competitions this season, conceding 16 goals along the way - and on this occasion the goals against tally could have been more significantly added to. Gervinho was their tormentor-in-chief with a goal and two assists, although he might have scored at least a hat-trick with better finishing. The Ivorian was first to breach Reading's defence when he escaped two defenders to intercept Cazorla's drive with a neat finish. The hosts felt they deserved a penalty when former Arsenal keeper Stuart Taylor clattered Giroud after being lobbed by the Frenchman, but referee Chris Foy dismissed their appeals. Gervinho and Cazorla both went close to adding a second prior to the break and the pair combined again just after the restart to double Arsenal's lead. A sweeping move saw Cazorla feed Gervinho on the right and he cut inside before teeing up the Spaniard to bend a superb effort past Taylor from just outside the area. The goal finally sparked Reading into life and Pavel Pogrebnyak was denied by Laurent Koscielny's last-ditch challenge, while Alex Pearce headed straight at Lukasz Fabianski. But just as the Royals looked capable of forcing their way back into the match, they conceded possession from a corner and Gervinho fed Giroud and the Frenchman drilled a low strike across Taylor. Reading pulled one back as Robson-Kanu nodded home Jobi McAnuff's cross at the back post, yet that only heightened their sense of frustration at the lapse in concentration moments earlier. Oxlade-Chamberlain came on for Gervinho with 15 minutes remaining and made an immediate impact, running at Adrian Mariappa and drawing a trip from the defender just inside the box. Arteta wrong-footed Taylor from the penalty spot to cap a good day for Arsenal and another miserable afternoon for Reading.  Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger:  "We played with good collective spirit, technical quality and went always forward. We created many chances, that's the most pleasant thing. We were quite serious. We defended well, had good discipline and didn't become easy when the game became easy. "He [Gervinho] was always lively and created many dangerous situations. I'm sorry because in the game he had an assist, he scored but he had more chances. He lacked a bit of confidence in front of goal. "We are in a position where we have only one target and that is to win our games, that's what we try to do. If you look around, you could lose games. We have to focus and, after, we see where we stand. "We have a new team and know now it's a very serious time for us to get the points. The team has found a better balance maybe between attack and defence."  Reading manager Nigel Adkins:  "I thought Arsenal were very good, they've come here and passed the ball very well. Unfortunately, we've made our own downfall on a couple of goals. We wanted to adapt a couple of changes, but any team who came here would have found it difficult today. "We'll learn the lessons. We've only had a few days together as a group.  We'll have a full week of training now. We'll analyse the game, there's a lot we want to change but we can't do it all in one game. "We'll have a good debrief on Monday and Tuesday and get ready for the next game. There's only one way we can go and that's up. "The lads have come a long way. We need to work hard in training, be as efficient as we can and give ourselves an opportunity in the next one."

24.04.2013 23:34:18 Manchester City outclassed Newcastle United to strengthen their grip on second place in the Premier League and ensure Manchester United did not increase their already commanding lead at the top. United had briefly extended their advantage to 18 points by beating Sunderland earlier in the day but City responded with a convincing performance and victory that showed that, although they might have failed in the defence of their title , they are not about to throw it away. Newcastle, who remain in danger at the other end of the table, defended with determination early on but Carlos Tevez and David Silva scored in quick succession before the break and, after it, Vincent Kompany and a James Perch own goal completed a one-sided victory. Newcastle's intention to frustrate initially served them so well that it took almost half an hour before the game's first meaningful chance, which came when the Magpies made a rare foray forward and saw Papiss Cisse fizz a sweet volley against the outside of Joe Hart's post. From then on, City took control, firstly by finding a way through Newcastle's massed backline, and then by finally finding the net. City boss Roberto Mancini has often berated his side for being wasteful this season so he might not have been surprised to see Gareth Barry somehow blast over from six yards out with the goal gaping. On this occasion, however, misses like that did not make much difference to the champions in the end. There was more frustration for the home fans when a fine Rob Elliot stop kept out Gael Clichy's drive, Silva curled a free-kick wide and Edin Dzeko sent a header looping over the bar. But the breakthrough finally came four minutes before the break. Silva sent Clichy galloping down the left and his low cross found Tevez sliding in to convert. While Newcastle looked crushed, City were buoyant - and another goal for the home side followed moments later. Elliot clawed another Dzeko drive to safety but could do nothing to keep out Silva's low effort after Nasri danced into the area. Understandably, the Magpies changed their gameplan at the break and emerged on the attack. Yohan Cabaye played a clever one-two with Moussa Sissoko and drilled a low shot a fraction wide, and Sissoko was just off target himself with two more efforts. City were hardly rocking, however, and got the goal that sealed the points shortly before the hour mark. When a corner was not cleared, Barry's shot was deflected into the path of Kompany, who marked his return after two months out injured by turning it into the net. Newcastle, to their credit, continued to come forward but that was more in hope than any expectation of salvaging anything from the game. That hope disappeared for good with City's fourth goal, on 69 minutes. Yaya Toure crashed in a ball from the right that took a touch off Danny Simpson's foot and span past Elliot at his near post. Elliot capped a fine individual display with another fingertip save to keep out a curling shot from City substitute Scott Sinclair but his side were well beaten by the end.

24.04.2013 23:34:18 Chelsea's hopes of qualifying for the Champions League suffered a setback as Jay Rodriguez and Rickie Lambert scored to earn struggling Southampton victory. Rodriguez opened the scoring with a composed 23rd-minute finish after good work by Lambert and SteveN Davis. John Terry marked his first league start since 2 February by heading a 33rd-minute equaliser from a corner. But Lambert's 25-yard free-kick earned the Saints victory as Chelsea suffered a third straight away league defeat. Southampton climbed to 13th in the table after establishing a four-point safety cushion from the relegation places, with Mauricio Pochettino's side recording back-to-back league wins for the first time since November. But while the Saints appear to have hit form at the right time, the same cannot be said of Chelsea. With visits to Liverpool and Manchester United on the horizon, Blues interim boss Rafael Benitez must find a solution for his team's travel problems if they are to cement a top-four finish. Chelsea dropped to fourth in the table, just two points ahead of fifth-placed Arsenal. This was not the way Benitez intended to start Chelsea's most crucial spell of the season. With an FA Cup tie against Manchester United on Monday, Chelsea made seven changes to the side that overcame West Ham on their last Premier League outing. Yet Benitez will have expected much more from those on duty, as Southampton, who had 24 points fewer than their opponents before the start, showed more hunger and desire. Chelsea, who also face a crucial Europa League game against Rubin Kazan on Thursday, failed to heed the warning signs even after Rodriguez produced a fine finish following a clever build-up involving Davis and Lambert. The lead lasted just 10 minutes as Terry was allowed to head his second league goal of the season following poor defending from a corner. That should have awoken Chelsea from their slumber but the Saints regained the initiative through a sublime 35th-minute Lambert strike. The 31-year-old former Bristol Rovers and Rochdale striker marked the 500th league appearance of his career with a terrific curling free-kick which Chelsea keeper Petr Cech could do little about. Saints fans responded with chants of "Lambert for England" after the striker took his Premier League goal tally for the season to 14. The home side was forced to bring on substitute goalkeeper Kelvin Davies at the start of the second-half after Artur Boruc complained of dizziness. But Chelsea still could not muster an equaliser, Victor Moses coming closest with a swerving effort which former Sunderland stopper Davies did well to tip over the bar.  Southampton manager Mauricio Pochettino:  "Victories like today prove that we are on the right path. "It is very important for the confidence of my players and especially the people surrounding our club, the technical staff. "It is important that we believe we can achieve results as we saw today and we can continue achieving them in the future."  Chelsea interim manager Rafael Benitez:  "I think that you could see that in the first half we didn't have the intensity we were expecting. "We improved in the second half, made more chances, but still we didn't make the right decisions in the final third. "But at least we were there and made the chances."

24.04.2013 23:34:18 Tottenham moved up to third in the Premier League after an impressive win over Swansea at the Liberty Stadium. After two successive league defeats, Spurs went ahead when Jan Vertonghen played a neat one-two with Gareth Bale and slotted home from close range. Vertonghen then found Bale who fired a 20-yard shot into the top corner. Nathan Dyer headed against the bar, and as the home side applied more pressure after the break Michu headed in off the post, but Spurs held on for a key win. A lacklustre defeat in a seemingly routine home fixture against mid-table Fulham two weeks ago led some critics to speculate on whether Spurs might suffer the kind of malaise that resulted in only one win from nine at a similar stage last term, a sequence that, combined with Chelsea's Champions League success, cost them a place in Europe's elite club competition. But after the international break they were bright and purposeful in possession from the outset against a Swansea side that had also lost their last two league games, and something of the fluency that inspired their League Cup triumph last month. The first goal was beautifully started and finished by the composed defender Vertonghen, Tottenham's summer signing from Ajax. He collected the ball on the halfway line, found Bale and continued his run as the Welsh attacker lifted the ball delicately over the Swansea backline. The versatile Belgian controlled it superbly before poking under the advancing Michel Vorm to register his fourth goal in his last five matches for the Lilywhites. Spurs should have doubled their lead shortly afterwards when Mousa Dembele freed Emmanuel Adebayor, but the Togolese international, who has scored only two league goals this term, shot tamely at the goalkeeper. However, star player Bale soon put them in command with another classic strike to add to his burgeoning collection. Vertonghen sent a cleverly disguised pass to his team-mate, playing just behind lone striker Adebayor, and after controlling the ball masterfully with his first touch, Bale fizzed it into the corner with his second, his 22nd goal of the season and his 12th away from home. Swansea were struggling to provide suitable service for their leading scorer Michu but the skilful Spaniard eluded his markers to meet a corner, although he sent his header the wrong side of the woodwork. The home side gradually began to play their way back into the contest and Dyer headed against the bar; but to the frustration of the Welsh crowd the ball trickled narrowly wide after rebounding back off the winger. A quickly taken free-kick on the edge of the area soon after the interval could have given them a lifeline but Brad Friedel, starting his first league game since November in the absence of the injured Hugo Lloris, raced off his line to smother Michu's shot. Michu then headed a chance wide following another accurate cross from the marauding Dwight Tiendalli but the striker was not to be denied his first goal since the Wembley showpiece a month ago, glancing his header from a right-wing corner powerfully past a helpless Friedel. Having surrendered a 2-1 lead to lose at Liverpool, fresh questions returned about Tottenham in tense situations. Bale hit the outside of the post after a trademark surging run on the break but was then required at the other end to make a vital block in his own penalty area as Spurs withstood some sustained pressure. They return to Europa League in midweek with the first-leg of their quarter-final against Basel, but with seven matches remaining in an ever absorbing race for the top four, will be hopeful of appearing on an even bigger stage next term.  Swansea manager Michael Laudrup:  "They had a very good start but both goals showed a player of Gareth Bale's quality can make the difference. "With the first we could have done better even if it was a good pass and finish. "But the second goal was just a fantastic finish by a very good player. If you take Bale out, without him the teams were at the same level. "We felt they could be tired after having so many players on international duty and in the second half we dominated, we scored one and got close, but not close enough, to a second."  Tottenham boss Andre Villas-Boas:  "When there are so many things that go well for the team it is hard to single out individuals but Gareth is a world class player offensively and defensively, as he showed when he made the block at the end to prevent Swansea getting a draw. "But the whole team deserve credit because coming here after two league defeats and playing the way we did is never easy. "We spoke at half-time about trying to get the third goal to put it beyond doubt but we couldn't and they did well to come back. "We showed great determination and the winning mentality that surrounds us to come away and hold on for a great win from home and put ourselves back on track."

24.04.2013 23:34:18 Andy Carroll scored twice to ease West Ham's fears of dropping into the Championship with a win over West Brom. The striker's thumping header gave the home side the lead, before Hammers goalkeeper Jussi Jaaskelainen was forced into action with smart saves. Gary O'Neil's sweet strike doubled the advantage with Carroll's superb volley giving the hosts a third goal. Baggies' Graham Dorrans scored a late penalty and Youssouf Mulumbu was sent off for kicking the ball at O'Neil. West Ham's comfortable victory means they are now on 36 points, six clear of the bottom three, with eight games of the season remaining. Having suffered five defeats in their previous seven league matches, Sam Allardyce's men were in danger of being dragged into a relegation battle.  Allardyce stated a total of 38 points would be enough to stay in the Premier League and said that he would only sign a new contract with the club - which runs out at the end of the season - once they are certain of survival. Meanwhile, his counterpart Steve Clarke is enduring a slight blip as they missed the chance to move ahead of Liverpool into seventh spot, having enjoyed a fine season so far. The Baggies found it difficult to deal with Carroll's aerial presence throughout, and were afforded no time on the ball by West Ham's pressing game with Mohamed Diame particularly imposing. The visitors started well, having a goal rightly disallowed before Romelu Lukaku's deflected free-kick forced Jaaskelainen into a magnificent save low to his right-hand side. Despite West Brom's early pressure, the home side took control and went ahead through on-loan frontman Carroll. The Englishman rose highest to power in his fourth goal of the season when he produced a towering header from O'Neil's corner after 16 minutes. Minutes later, both Diame and Matt Jarvis had opportunities to double the Hammers' advantage, but neither player could hit the target. However, the second did arrive soon after. A quick break from the home side allowed Ricardo Vaz Te to find O'Neil on the edge of the area, and the midfielder curled a strike over the helpless Ben Foster. West Brom were looking for some inspiration to get back into the match in the second half and nearly found it through Belgian striker Lukaku, who fired a blistering drive narrowly over the bar, before full-back Billy Jones was thwarted by the excellent Jaaskelainen. The home side wrapped the game up through Carroll, who allowed James Collins' free-kick to drop over his shoulder before despatching a volley into the bottom corner. Dorrans grabbed a consolation for West Brom from the penalty spot with three minutes remaining, after Lukaku was fouled in the box by Matt Taylor. And there was still time for Mulumbu's bizarre dismissal, when the Congolese midfielder picked the ball up after being fouled and kicked it against O'Neil in frustration.  West Ham manager Sam Allardyce:  "The points are more important than anything else but the performance along with the result and the fact that we won comfortably shows how good we have been at home all season. "Andy Carroll scored the goal of the season for us, it was a fantastic goal, a world class finish. He scored two today and it was his best performance. "It was an important win for us, putting us back in 11th spot and it is about where we have been all season. It shows the consistency for the season."  West Brom manager Steve Clarke:  "We knew it would be a difficult game, and in the first half they were a little bit better than us. The goals ewe conceded are not like us. "We started the game quite well, but there are small margins in this game. After being 1-0 down, we had a difficult afternoon. "There are not been too many times this season that we have felt like this. We have seven game and we want to finish on a high."

24.04.2013 23:34:18 Arsenal moved back into third place in the Premier League with an unconvincing London derby win over 10-man Fulham. The Gunners dominated early on and seemed to have been gifted a path to victory by Steve Sidwell's 12th-minute dismissal for a lunge on Mikel Arteta. But Fulham posed the greater threat and Arsenal were fortunate to lead at half-time through Per Mertesacker's header. They continued to struggle but held on despite Olivier Giroud's red card for a last-minute lunge on Stanislav Manolev. That evened the numbers up for a thrilling period of injury time in which the Cottagers came close to salvaging an unlikely but deserved draw and denting the visitors' chances of finishing in the Champions League places. A surging early run from Manolev apart, Fulham had barely got out of their own half before Sidwell's dismissal for his needless challenge. Sidwell had only returned to the side after serving a three-match ban and his moment of madness seemed likely to lead to an Arsenal onslaught. But following his red card, Fulham were the better side for long spells. They made full use of their pace on the counter-attack and Dimitar Berbatov's ability to link up play, and they could easily have gone ahead. Fulham, who have now picked up just one point from their last four matches, already looked intent on sitting deep and frustrating opponents who had failed to break down a resolute Everton defence in midweek.  Sidwell's sending off ensured they had little option but to play on the break, and although Fulham slipped to a second successive derby defeat in the space of four days, they looked the more likely to score in open play. Berbatov had a fierce strike beaten away by goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny after a brilliant 40-yard run and pass by Bryan Ruiz. And Alex Kacaniklic, recalled from a loan spell at Burnley to ease an injury crisis, twice caused problems after a threatening run forward. The Gunners, who have now won eight of their last 10 league games, looked ponderous and, although dominating possession, were struggling to create chances. Giroud came closest to breaking the deadlock with a fine low strike across goal that hit the outside of the post after good work by Santi Cazorla. They did take the lead just before the break from a Theo Walcott set-piece when Mertesacker headed home from close range after Laurent Koscielny's mistimed header across goal. However that did not relax the visitors, who looked increasingly edgy during a lifeless second half, devoid of clear chances. Fulham continued to threaten on the counter-attack and Manolev, after one such break, thought he had equalised but was offside when he turned the ball in on the rebound after Szczesny saved Kieran Richardson's free-kick. But despite a sloppy second-half display, Arsenal withstood the late pressure after Giroud's red card to move two points clear of fourth-placed Chelsea - although they have played two more games than the Blues.  Fulham manager Martin Jol: ""I was annoyed with him [Sidwell], but he says it is not intentional. He will regret that tackle. It was the first foul that spoilt the game. "I know it was not intentional because he wanted to play. He has just come back from a three-match suspension and now he is out for another four matches again so it was not only disappointing for him, but also for us because we had to play with 10 men for a long time. "But we fought like lions and had better chances than them. In the first half we did ever so well but conceded a soft goal."  Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger: "I think the referee could only give a red card [to Sidwell]. We will see [if Arteta is okay]. He played the second-half. I don't know how much damage is done. It is a kick, a bad kick. "I don't know if he has twisted his ankle or not. In these kind of things it is a question of a fraction of a second. If you are fully on your foot at the moment you get it you break your leg. If you ease a bit off maybe that is why he got away with it. "We had a positive first half but in the second half we became sloppy with our passing and played with less pace to our game. "You have to give Fulham credit; they are a good side and they played very well. It became hard in the second half. We played with the handbrake on and tried to keep the lead without taking risks. We didn't give them enough problems. We lost pace and quality."

24.04.2013 23:34:18 Arouna Kone's late winner moved Wigan out of the Premier League's bottom three and left Norwich only four points above the relegation zone. The Ivorian was played in by Jordi Gomez before launching a fierce low drive that beat the dive of Canaries goalkeeper Lee Camp. The goal came just moments after Antolin Alcaraz, James McCarthy and Gomez went close for the Latics. Norwich's best effort fell to Bradley Johnson, whose shot flew inches wide. That result means the Canaries have only one victory to show for in their last 14 league games and sit on 34 points. In contrast, Roberto Martinez's Wigan have recorded three league wins from four. The latest sees them move above Aston Villa on goal difference, with Villa playing Liverpool on Sunday. The Latics will now go to fellow strugglers QPR next Sunday in good heart and with a strong belief that they will repeat last season's escapology act. However, for much of the 90 minutes the home team could barely string three passes together, never mind make it three successive victories. Apart from two Kone chances - one that drifted a foot wide of Camp's post and another which was blocked brilliantly by Sebastien Bassong - they did not look like a team fighting for Premier League survival. But with 20 minutes remaining, the Latics appeared suddenly to realise what was at stake. First, Alcaraz tested the Norwich goal with a header that was cleared off the line by Jonny Howson and then McCarthy let fly with an angled effort that whistled past the post. Gomez, who was one of Wigan's better players, was also denied by some more brilliant Norwich defending when Michael Turner threw himself in front of his shot. Just as seemed as if Norwich would head back east with a 14th league draw this season, Wigan pierced the last line of defence thanks to the impressive Kone. The Ivory Coast forward had not been served well by his team-mates all afternoon until Gomez picked him out with a threaded ball. He took the ball in his stride before arrowing a shot inside Camp's near post. Norwich boss Chris Hughton had brought on Grant Holt seconds earlier, but he was given little time and opportunities to salvage something for his side.  Wigan manager Roberto Martinez:  "I don't think we were stylish as we normally are, but what we showed is an incredible character. Every player found a way to help the team to keep Norwich very quiet. "To restrict any team in the Premier League to no shots on target requires massive effort. And then it was that little bit of quality at the other end. "It seemed it couldn't quite fall for us but that's as good a goal as you're going to see in this league. The ball from Jordi Gomez was a fantastic, clinical ball, and the finish of Arouna Kone was just what he deserved for his work ethic."  Norwich boss Chris Hughton:  "When you go away from home sometimes you have to hold your hand up if you've been beaten and beaten well but I don't think anybody seeing the game today would think that. "We certainly deserved a draw and then it's just going to be about those moments. They had it and we didn't. "But I thought for an away team we had good periods of the game where we had good control but it's one moment that's beaten us. It's very disappointing."

24.04.2013 23:34:18 Manchester United took another stride towards a 20th league title with a comfortable victory at Sunderland. United's first-half winner came when Robin van Persie fired in a shot from the left which flew into the net off the knee of Titus Bramble. Sunderland never looked like breaching a United defence that has not conceded a Premier League goal in 627 minutes. Van Persie was denied in stoppage time by Simon Mignolet as injury-hit Sunderland finished deflated. The result leaves Premier League leaders United 15 points ahead of Manchester City with eight matches remaining and a home derby against their nearest challengers to come on Monday week. While manager Sir Alex Ferguson knows another league title is almost in United's grasp, the result leaves Sunderland boss Martin O'Neill looking nervously at the bottom end of the table, his side are only one point ahead of 17th-placed Wigan who have a game in hand. Sunderland - with Danny Graham leading the line in place of the injured Steven Fletcher - started positively with the visitors initially looking a little unsure at the back but the Black Cats were unable to create a clear chance to test keeper David De Gea. United, unbeaten at Sunderland since 1997, soon settled and began to seize the initiative as both teams sparred for the right to break the deadlock. And the stalemate was broken as United took the lead just before the half hour with a goal that had an element of fortune. Van Persie jinked past Phil Bardsley on the left side of the penalty box before hitting a low shot which first brushed against Bardsley, then deflected off Bramble before passing Mignolet. Van Persie - without a goal for United in seven games - appeared to claim the strike but it was recorded as a Bramble own goal. Ferguson was immediately forced into a change as Rafael limped off with a groin injury. Chris Smalling switched to right-back with Jonny Evans partnering Nemanja Vidic in central defence. Sunderland goalkeeper Mignolet then did well to tip away a wickedly curling Van Persie free-kick as United threatened to increase their lead before the break. O'Neill must have demanded more movement and energy from his depleted side during the interval after a lethargic first-half showing. United looked more than comfortable but De Gea was anything but after an accidental clash with Vidic left him needing lengthy treatment. Sunderland tried to raise their game after the break but United were happy to probe for a second goal while protecting their advantage. Adam Johnson forced Smalling to head to safety from his nicely flighted cross, which De Gea, who was still feeling the effects of his collision with Vidic, was happy to leave his central defender to clear. The home side enjoyed a better spell as the game entered its final quarter and O'Neill introduced Connor Wickham and Sebastian Larsson in a bid to put United under more pressure. Alexander Buttner combined well with Ashley Young before unleashing a fierce shot which Mignolet did well to push away for a corner from which Vidic flashed a header wide. United remained almost in cruise control and Van Persie was denied by Mignolet deep into injury time. Sunderland failed to create a decisive effort on the visitors' goal as their winless run extended to eight league matches. While the Black Cats face a fight to avoid the drop, United will freshen up their team for Monday's FA Cup quarter-final replay at Chelsea in full knowledge that another Premier League title is within touching distance.  Sunderland manager Martin O'Neill:  "We were a little bit tentative in the first half and the own goal just about sums up the way things have been going. "I think there was a little bit of tension and a lack of confidence. We gave Manchester United a bit too much time and space when they are the best team in the league. "We tried to do something about it and we exerted a lot of pressure though without actually creating a clear-cut chances. The players were disappointed at half time but they galvanised and it was a terrific performance in the second half."

24.04.2013 23:34:18 Frank Lampard scored his 200th goal for Chelsea who moved into third place with a win over West Ham. The Blues dominated the match at Stamford Bridge and took the lead in the first half when Lampard nodded in Eden Hazard's through ball. Hazard added a second after the break when he cut in from the right and arrowed a strike past the reach of Hammers goalkeeper Jussi Jaaskelainen. Chelsea should have won by more, but Demba Ba wasted several chances. Ba found himself in a one-on-one with Jaaskelainen. Luckily for the former Newcastle striker, Chelsea's midfielders bailed him out with outstanding individual performances. The veteran of that pack, Lampard, will steal the headlines, but it was Hazard who was the star performer. The Belgium international, who signed from Lille for about Â£32million last summer, was the catalyst for many of the Blues' attacks and produced a sublime goal. Hazard's first telling contribution saw him fire in a wicked shot that West Ham's Finnish keeper could only fist back into play. The ball eventually came back to Hazard on the edge of the area and his lofted pass was met with a firm header by Lampard. The England international is now only two goals away from equalling Bobby Tambling's club record tally. Lampard scored his goal at the end where the away fans were sitting. He celebrated with substitute John Terry, who was warming up in that section of the ground, as objects were thrown from the crowd in their direction. The Metropolitan Police later confirmed they were investigating incidents of coin throwing, but that no arrests had been made. Blues manager Rafael Benitez handed Victor Moses a start, and the former Wigan player narrowly failed to add to the home side's lead when his shot drifted wide. Central defender David Luiz also made forays forward, forcing a low save from Jaaskelainen, before striking a spectacular volley that screamed past the bar. Chelsea finally got their second after the break, when Hazard teased his markers on the right, played a one-two with Juan Mata, before racing into the area and firing low inside the Hammers near post. It was a strike befitting of his classy performance. Hazard could have added to his tally but was denied by Jaaskelainen and a block from Joey O'Brien. West Ham did not cause much worry in the Chelsea defence. They did have the ball in the net when Andy Carroll slotted in after winning a jostle with Luiz, but referee Michael Oliver penalised the ex-Newcastle man for pushing the Brazilian. Carroll won several aerial battles in the area but his headers were tame. It was not until the final five minutes that the Hammers created their best chance when substitute Carlton Cole forced Petr Cech to dive low to keep out his poked effort. Chelsea's 16th win of the season moves them a point above Tottenham, who earlier lost to Fulham, and to within four points of second-placed Manchester City. Benitez's side have a run of six games in two weeks when they resume after the international break on 30 March, but recent performances suggest they have the personnel to cope.  Chelsea manager Rafael Benitez:  "It was a good game, a great results, Frank scored his 200th, the team is third so it's a great week and a good moment for us. "It is a long race, we have to carry on and win our next game and see what others do. "In the first half, we could have scored two or three goals. You have to be pleased because we scored two goals and kept a clean sheet. We have to be a little disappointed because we could have finished it earlier. "Demba Ba is a great finisher and today it was not his day. "We will approach it one game at a time. We have to relax now and not get any injuries after the international break."  West Ham manager Sam Allardyce:  "Sometimes, you come to places like this and you have to hope the top players are not on song, but young Eden Hazard made life extremely difficult for us. The quality of the players in that area, including Juan Mata, with the support of Frank Lampard, was too much for us on the day. "We had a couple of chances and you have to try and put them in the net. We did not do that and we have suffered for it. They deserved to win and we have to accept that. It is not going to define our season, beating them once is enough, beating them again would just be greedy. "Andy Carroll had a couple of chances, and we would expect him to hit the target. If we get to 2-1, they might panic. The free-kick given for the disallowed goal on David Luiz was soft. "Their second was brilliant. Hazard's trickery, pace and quality of finishing, the defenders could not cope with it. "We would like six points and get to 39 points as quick as we can."

24.04.2013 23:34:18 Arouna Kone's last-minute goal gave Wigan a vital victory in a game marred by a horror tackle by Callum McManaman on Newcastle defender Massadio Haidara. Jean Beausejour put the Latics in front when a McManaman cross was not cleared. McManaman was not punished for a high lunge on Haidara and Magpies assistant John Carver was sent off after trying to confront the forward at half-time. Davide Santon levelled but Kone won it from a corner which Wigan defender Maynor Figueroa appeared to handle. The win leaves Wigan three points adrift of safety, with a game in hand on fourth-bottom Aston Villa. But Newcastle will feel aggrieved, firstly by how McManaman escaped a card for his dangerous challenge and also over Figueroa's handball to flick on the cross that led to Kone's scrambled winner. Referee Mark Halsey did not even award a free-kick for McManaman's tackle on Haidara, who had been on the pitch for only a matter of minutes after replacing the injured Mathieu Debuchy. The 20-year-old was eventually stretchered off after lengthy treatment. Although McManaman did clip the ball, it was his follow through into Haidara's knee that did the damage. Newcastle's coaching staff reacted angrily and, along with Wigan first-team coach Graham Barrow, Carver saw red at half-time after scuffling as the teams headed for the tunnel. Wigan had dominated the first half, with Newcastle's only meaningful early effort seeing Steven Taylor nod Sylvain Marveaux's corner straight at Latics keeper Joel Robles. The Latics were well organised at the back and looking to break quickly down the flanks and it was from a cross that they took the lead on 18 minutes. McManaman beat Haidara and lifted over a delivery that Santon could not clear, allowing Beausejour to pounce and drill home a low shot. More Wigan chances followed, with Shaun Maloney seeing his curling shot saved and only a last-ditch challenge from Jonas Gutierrez denying James McCarthy after the midfielder burst clear. And Newcastle remained on the backfoot immediately after the break, with only a smart block by Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa denying McManaman. McManaman was taken off before the hour mark, bringing boos from the travelling Newcastle fans. But it was a Magpies switch that appeared to have changed the game, with striker Shola Ameobi replacing midfielder Yoan Gouffran as Alan Pardew moved to a three-man defence that allowed Santon to venture further forward down the right. The Italy defender did precisely that to level with 18 minutes remaining, latching on to Papiss Cisse's clever pass inside the Latics box after Wigan lost possession and burying a low shot into the bottom corner. Cisse, who has scored two late winners in the past week, almost struck again from Ameobi's cross but Robles diverted his shot wide. Instead it was Kone who settled an eventful match. Figueroa used his hand as he leapt to help on McCarthy's corner at the near post and, after the ball bounced around the Newcastle box and James Perch and Santon failed to deal with the danger, the Ivorian was in the right place to slam home from close range.  Wigan manager Roberto Martinez:  "Three points at this stage of the season is huge. We went through a period where we have to score a second goal otherwise it becomes difficult. But I could not be prouder of the character - especially at this stage of the season. "Without scoring the second goal when we were leading 1-0, we found a way to win. "The character was magnificent. They were very strong with good individual players who are a real threat. "I don't feel we have had any luck whatsoever this season and the way we work I think we deserved that luck. "We had so many opportunities and we couldn't find the final pass so we made it difficult, but we found a way to win and that pleased me."

24.04.2013 23:34:18 Dimitar Berbatov returned to haunt his old club as he grabbed Fulham's winner to dent Tottenham's hopes of a top-four league finish. Gareth Bale had an early Spurs header cleared off the line by defender Sascha Riether but the home side looked jaded. Berbatov struck when he slotted in a low Riether cross before team-mate Brede Hangeland headed just wide. Spurs' Jermain Defoe had a close-range shot brilliantly saved by Mark Schwarzer late on as Fulham held on. Berbatov did not celebrate his winner against his former employers, although Tottenham's rivals for a top four spot, Arsenal and Everton, who both won on Saturday and have a game in hand, will be overjoyed. Spurs now lead north London neighbours Arsenal by just four points and are six ahead of the Toffees in the chase for a Champions League spot for next season.. The victory was Fulham's first in 10 games at White Hart Lane since 2003 and will raise fears among Spurs fans over the kind of collapse they suffered towards the end of last season, which ultimately cost them a Champions League place. The home side, who dropped a place to fourth after Chelsea's win, were not helped by an exhausting Europa League tie, which went to extra-time, at Inter Milan on Thursday night on the back of last Sunday's defeat at Liverpool. Nevertheless, against a Fulham side which had not played since 2 March, the White Hart Lane outfit struggled to get going. Bale was back in the Spurs side after being suspended for the trip to Italy and was part of five changes made by manager Andre Villas-Boas. The Wales international, who was signed by Spurs in 2007 by now-Cottagers boss Martin Jol, quickly went close when his steered header from corner was cleared off the line by Riether. However, a rusty Fulham's lack of action for two weeks and a tired Tottenham's heavy schedule made for a low-key game as both sides lacked rhythm and sharpness. Berbatov did put in a dangerous low cross just before half-time, which keeper Hugo Lloris parried and hooked clear before the lurking Bryan Ruiz could pounce. Villas-Boas brought on ex-Fulham forward Clint Dempsey for injured centre-back Michael Dawson at the break, although his side were dealt a blow after 52 minutes. Bale had a long-range shot saved by keeper Schwarzer and Fulham went straight up the other end and scored, with Berbatov turning in a low cross from overlapping right-back Riether. Minutes later, Fulham almost added a second but centre-back Hangeland nodded inches wide after Ruiz flicked on a Giorgos Karagounis corner. Villa-Boas threw on striker Defoe in a bid to salvage something from the game and the move would have paid off had it not been for Schwarzer's heroics. Firstly, the Australian keeper saved Defoe's first-time shot from a right-wing Steve Caulker cross. Schwarzer then pulled off a fantastic reaction save at point-blank range after the England international tried to sidefoot in a Bale cross at the near post. And Fulham saw the game out to inflict a first home defeat on Spurs since 3 November.  Fulham manager Martin Jol: "To get a win here against my old club is fantastic. "In the first half we restricted them. We knew they could have been a bit tired. "We could have scored a second goal but we didn't and they could have got a point out of it at the end. Mark Schwarzer made an incredible save and, at the end, it was nerve-racking."

24.04.2013 23:34:18 Ten-man Norwich City earned a deserved point at fellow Premier League strugglers Sunderland in a controversial game. City led when Wes Hoolahan nodded in from a yard after Kei Kamara's header. But the lacklustre hosts were gifted a way back into the game when Canaries goalkeeper Mark Bunn handled outside his box and was sent off on 30 minutes. Craig Gardner soon levelled from the penalty spot after another disputed handball but Norwich held on with ease. Visiting manager Chris Hughton will have been far happier with both the performance and a result which moves his side 10 points clear of the relegation zone prior to Wigan's game against Newcastle.  The Canaries were the better side for long periods, and managed to pose the greater threat going forward. They remained compact and disciplined, despite playing for more than an hour with 10 men. But Hughton's pleasure will have been tempered by the two first-half handballs and a third close call which saw his side denied a possible spot-kick of their own after the break when Danny Rose handled on the edge of the box. Sunderland, who edge seven points clear of the bottom three after a seventh successive game without a win, looked short of confidence and barely threatened after the interval until Stephane Sessegnon wasted a good chance in the final five minutes. And the fact they looked so lifeless in attack and lacking in ideas and guile against 10 men is a major concern as they head into a difficult survival run-in. They face Manchester United, Chelsea, Newcastle and Everton in the next five weeks. Sunderland were given every chance of addressing their miserable run when Michael Turner's defensive aberration led to Bunn's red card. Up until then Norwich were the better side. They looked solid and organised and were largely untroubled defensively during an uninspiring opening half-hour which silenced the home crowd. A nervy Sunderland's only sight of goal saw Steven Fletcher's shot smothered by Bunn. That chance apart, Norwich had posed the greater threat and, after a sustained spell of pressure, they took the lead courtesy of a well-worked corner when Hoolahan headed in Kamara's goalbound header from less than a yard. But within four minutes Hoolahan's afternoon was over. Former Sunderland centre-half Michael Turner tried to head the ball back to Bunn who came charging out of his area to clear his lines but could only block an awkward bouncing ball with his arms and was duly sent off. Craig Gardner went agonisingly close to equalising from the free-kick but his effort beat both replacement goalkeeper Lee Camp, who came on for Hoolahan, and the post. Norwich were furious and momentarily lost their composure, and a second handball call allowed the hosts to level from the penalty spot. This time it was the other Norwich centre-half Sebastien Bassong who was the culprit, stretching his left arm out towards another difficult bouncing ball. Norwich felt Fletcher was offside in the build-up but referee Chris Foy awarded the spot-kick after consulting his assistant linesman Peter Banks and Gardner smashed home the penalty high to Camp's right to make it 1-1. The game settled after a frenetic end to the first period but Sunderland's expected second-half onslaught never materialised. Gardner saw another fizzing effort brushed over the bar by Camp soon after the restart and Sessegnon miscued a volley when well placed late on. In between Norwich remained the more cohesive side and defended superbly and could easily have taken all three points. As well as the penalty shout when Rose's handball only resulted in a free-kick, substitute Grant Holt wasted a great one-on-one opportunity when he took a heavy touch.  Sunderland manager Martin O'Neill:  "We had an opportunity to go and try to get three points. They were down to 10 men, we got back into the game and had the whole second half to force the winner and couldn't. It was a disappointing second half. "My main concern was the chances. We should have created a lot more chances and were unable to do that. "It's difficult - it's been difficult all season for us. But we have games still to play, tough matches, every one of them. But the whole league has been tough for us. "They are all difficult games. This is the league. You play everybody twice, this is the run of games. "But we had a situation around about Christmas-time when people were showing the fixture list then, and we were able to win back-to-back games against Southampton and Manchester City, so we have to go and do that again. "My concern, obviously, is the players going away on international duty. I won't see them for some time and I'm hoping they come back in one piece."  Norwich manager Chris Hughton:  "Everybody will speak about three big decisions, but I owe it to this group of lads to praise the quality of the performance. "Yes, they had a lot of shots from outside the box, a lot of crosses we had to deal with and well, but I can't praise my players highly enough, to be down to 10 men for as long as we were. "I thought in normal play we had probably the best chance of the game when Grant Holt was through - if his touch was a little bit softer, he was on for a one v one. "But I can't remember a clear chance that Sunderland had, so I think we have got to give credit to a group of lads who were desperate to get something out of this game. "The lad has come from an offside position [for Sunderland's penalty] - and that is the same linesman who gave the penalty decision. He has not given an offside and he has given a handball."

24.04.2013 23:34:18 A goal from Wayne Rooney helped Manchester United edge a step closer to the Premier League title with a stuttering victory over managerless Reading. Sir Alex Ferguson's side took full advantage of Manchester City's defeat at Everton to open up a 15-point gap at the top of the table with only nine games remaining. But it was a far from convincing performance from a much-changed United side, which failed to overwhelm Reading, led by caretaker boss Eamonn Dolan. Rooney's first half-strike deflected in after a surging Rio Ferdinand run, while Ashley Young also curled a shot inches wide. Reading almost equalised through Hal Robson-Kanu's shot and had a strong penalty appeal turned down when Nemanja Vidic pushed Adrian Mariappa after the interval. With United increasing their advantage over City by three points, though, Ferguson will care little and his side now only need to earn another 13 points to guarantee their 13th Premier League crown. That total could well be lower, since it assumes Roberto Mancini's men will take maximum points from their nine remaining fixtures. Reading remain second from bottom and are still seven points from safety after dismissing previous manager Brian McDermott before their trip to Old Trafford. But there was plenty of encouragement for the hard-working Royals, who hope to announce McDermott's successor before they return to action at Arsenal on 30 March, following the international break. Reading were perhaps aided by a disjointed United, who made eight changes to the side that drew with Chelsea in the FA Cup last week. But Ferdinand, one of three players to remain, highlighted his continuing value following his recall to the England set-up this week. Roy Hodgson's decision may have surprised Ferguson, but the 34-year-old defender was accomplished in defence and pinged a lovely cross-field pass to Young, who fizzed a shot wide, before setting up Rooney's goal. Ferdinand was allowed to surge forward in the 21st minute, bisecting the Reading midfield, before laying off to Rooney, whose shot was deflected in via Alex Pearce. It was harsh on Reading keeper Stuart Taylor, who made good saves from Rooney and Danny Welbeck, and the Royals spent the rest of the first period in relative comfort as United looked happy to sit on their lead. Indeed, it was the visitors who came closest to scoring next when Robson-Kanu's shot went inches wide of David De Gea's post after Garath McCleary cut in from the left. Dolan, who was taking charge of his first game in league football following a spell at Exeter when they were a non-league side, furiously guided his team from the touchline as they searched for a response. And they had a legitimate penalty appeal turned by referee Lee Mason just after the break when Vidic shoved Mariappa. At the other end, Robin van Persie, who had only scored one goal in his last nine games coming into this contest, stung Taylor's hands with a vicious free-kick and Rooney fired over late on. But the hosts will be relieved to come through unscathed, although a more incisive team than Reading could well have caused more problems.  Reading caretaker boss Eamonn Dolan: "I'm never proud when we lose but considering it has been a difficult week, and all we had to deal with, I'm pleased with the players and how they have gone about it. "They were very flat on Tuesday but we knew we had a job to do. I've been speaking to Brian McDermott as a friend all week. And in fact, Brian was the first to text after the match. "It was a clear penalty [on Adrian Mariappa] but I think the referee thought I was on work experience and 'perfect a little 1-0 loss for Reading' and would be fine. "I wouldn't have expected that from the referee but what can you do?" When asked whether he would 'throw his hat into the ring' (regarding becoming permanent manager), Dolan replied: "Brian is a great friend of mine, so that would be, I wouldn't do that, because that would be wrong."

24.04.2013 23:34:18 Aston Villa came from behind for the second week running to win and move six points clear of the relegation zone while keeping QPR rooted to the bottom.   Ex-Villa loanee Jermaine Jenas opened the scoring as he slid in a rebound. Gabriel Agbonlahor headed the hosts level in first-half added time, seconds after QPR had hit the post, before Andreas Weimann put Villa in front. Andros Townsend's deflected effort levelled the game, but Christian Benteke then slotted a vital winner. Villa manager Paul Lambert said before kick-off that he was not "unduly worried" about the drop, and back-to-back league victories for the first time since May 2011 following last weekend's triumph at relegation rivals Reading will have boosted his confidence further. The result also ended a recent revival from Harry Redknapp's side which had seen them beat Southampton and Sunderland in consecutive games. Despite the pressure surrounding it, the match started at a sedate pace as the hosts knocked the ball around confidently without creating any chances. As well as being the Premier League's fourth lowest scorers,    and the home side looked typically vulnerable as Rangers threatened with their first attack. Keeper Brad Guzan was tested twice by Christopher Samba.  First he pushed away the defender's dangerous looping header, then from the ensuing corner he scrambled to keep out a side-footed effort after Ciaran Clark's panicked clearance. Samba was involved again minutes later as he clashed heads with Nathan Baker, with the Villa defender forced off with concussion. This incident played a part in the opener as his replacement Joe Bennett under-hit an aimless pass into the centre of the pitch that was intercepted by Jenas. The midfielder, who has been capped 21 times by England and scored a tremendous half-volley in last Saturday's 3-1 win against Sunderland, found Zamora and was quickest to react when the striker's effort was saved. QPR were now in control and, after a superb curled effort from Â£8m January signing Loic Remy was saved, went within inches of doubling their lead as Jose Bosingwa rattled the post with a free-kick. Villa counter-attacked and equalised against the run of play thanks to Agbonlahor, who nodded in unmarked from a deep Matthew Lowton cross with Bosingwa failing to pick up his man. Spurred on by the late goal, a rejuvenated Villa dominated after the interval, with Weimann their most dangerous player. First, he forced Julio Cesar to tip over the crossbar after being found at the back post by Bennett, then the pair were involved as Villa took the lead. After QPR failed to clear a corner, the left-back put in an excellent diversionary run that opened up a gap for Weimann to beat the goalkeeper at his near-post with a low drive. The momentum was with Lambert men's but QPR broke up the pitch and found the back of the net after Tottenham loanee Townsend's harmless shot on the edge of the area ricocheted off Ron Vlaar's leg and into the corner. In prior months, Villa's lack of experience in the side had been cited as a cause of their relegation worries. But that problem was not evident as they rallied to go in front as Benteke took advantage of some non-existent marking from the visitors inside the penalty box to slot in his 13th Premier League goal of the season unopposed after being found by a low centre from the excellent Weimann. QPR reacted by pushing Villa back to the edge of their area in the final 10 minutes. With centre-backs Clark and Vlaar at the fore, a number of high balls were repelled before Clint Hill, much to the relief of the majority at Villa Park, shot over with the last kick of the game.

24.04.2013 23:34:18 An inspired Southampton earned a crucial win in their battle against relegation as they all but ended Liverpool's top-four hopes. The hosts stormed ahead when Jay Rodriguez nodded down for Morgan Schneiderlin to steer in a shot. Rickie Lambert's deflected free-kick added Saints' second before Philippe Coutinho slotted in for the visitors. But Rodriguez completed a home win when he side-footed in after his initial shot was saved by Brad Jones. At a rain-lashed St Mary's, the final whistle was the signal for Southampton to revel in only a second win in eight games as they moved seven points above the relegation zone. The south-coast club have now beaten Liverpool in four of the last five league games at home and the out-of-sorts visitors could have little complaint at the result. Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard said he wanted the Reds to have a "perfect" finish to the season.  But his team were off the pace from the start and any lingering aspirations of Champions League qualification appear to have been ended by a first defeat in four games. Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers refused to get carried away after the 3-2 win over Tottenham last Sunday and was proved right as the inconsistency which has blighted his side's season struck again. The hosts took the lead after six minutes: Gaston Ramirez flighting a left-footed cross to the far post where Rodriguez cushioned a header down for Schneiderlin, who guided past goalkeeper Jones from six yards. The home side were scything through Liverpool seemingly at will and Southampton skipper Adam Lallana sent a half-volley fizzing over after the Reds failed to clear their lines. Lambert also beat the offside trap to race clear, only to have his shot saved by the onrushing Jones. Liverpool centre-back Martin Skrtel looked rusty as he made his first start in a month - and his foul on Lambert led to Southampton's second, with the Saints striker's free-kick deflecting in off Daniel Sturridge. The movement and menace of Rodriguez was a key feature of the home side's attacking verve and, after Lallana's shot had been parried across goal by Jones, the forward's half-volley on the swivel went just high of a gaping goal. Liverpool belatedly and briefly raised themselves towards the end of the first half as Glen Johnson sent Coutinho clear, with the Brazilian's shot being blocked after keeper Artur Boruc came out to save. Coutinho had a spell on loan at Espanyol under Saints manager Mauricio Pochettino last season, with his former boss describing him as "similar to Lionel Messi" this week. And he atoned for his miss when he pulled one back on the stroke of half-time. A Luis Suarez cross was nodded back across the home goal by Gerrard and, after Sturridge's shot was blocked, Coutinho pounced to slot in. Both defences had an air of vulnerability about them after the break, although neither team could capitalise. Sturridge scuffed a shot wide after a Gerrard cross was only partially cleared, while Lallana was played through before his steered shot from a tight angle was saved. Liverpool struggled for any cutting edge and Rodriguez compounded their misery with his late goal. The forward waltzed through the Liverpool defence and, after his first shot was saved by Jones, Rodriguez slotted in the rebound to secure a deserved three points.  Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers: "It certainly wasn't how we have been playing in the past few weeks. "We didn't get going until it was 2-0 down. We conceded poor goals which has been unlike us and we are disappointed at that. "We never really got started. It certainly wasn't the level we have been at and it was one of those days for us."

24.04.2013 23:34:18 Stoke City moved into the top half of the Premier League table after a feeble goalless draw against West Bromwich Albion at Britannia Stadium. The Potters have won just one Premier League game since the new year and lacked attacking inspiration against the eighth-placed visitors. They could have snatched victory in injury-time but substitute Kenwyne Jones prodded straight at Ben Foster. Romelu Lukaku headed Albion's best chance over the bar in the second half. Stoke entered 2013 on the back of a 10-match unbeaten run which left them just four points adrift of the top six. But the draw against Albion was only their fifth point in 10 top-flight matches since the turn of the year. Tony Pulis has faced criticism from a section of the club's support in recent weeks, but the home fans appreciated their team's endeavour against the Baggies, if not their final product. Stoke are the Premier League's second lowest scorers, with just 27 goals in their 30 matches. Trinidad and Tobago striker Jones has scored only three times in the top-flight this season and showed a lack of conviction when he pounced on a high ball in front of the Albion goal. Pulis's side shaded possession in a competitive first half but were unable to create any clear-cut opportunities to test Foster on the visiting goalkeeper's return to his first professional club. Potters forward Jon Walters, making his 81st consecutive top-flight appearance, came closest to breaking the deadlock before the interval when his long-range shot looped off Albion defender Jonas Olsson before dropping wide of Foster's right-hand upright. While failing to stretch the recently recalled England goalkeeper, Stoke managed to protect their own goalkeeper with Albion restricted to just one effort at home stopper Asmir Begovic. Baggies captain Chris Brunt latched onto a throughball from James Morrison inside the opening five minutes but shot straight at Begovic who fumbled before gathering the ball at the second attempt. Albion have enjoyed a productive first season under the stewardship of head coach Steve Clarke and would have moved within four points of fifth-placed Arsenal had they forced a winner against the Potters. Belgium striker Lukaku has been in inspired form for the Baggies in recent weeks, having scored four goals in his past three matches, and somehow failed to net his 14th goal of the season shortly after the hour. Albion right-back Billy Jones stayed onside to collect Brunt's deflected free-kick before sweeping a cross into the danger-zone which cannoned off a startled Lukaku and went over the crossbar. Stoke striker Jones' late miss secured the draw and meant his team failed to score for a 13th league match - more than any other top-flight team.  Stoke manager Tony Pulis:  "It was a very honest, committed game with very few chances. Probably the best opportunity was Kenwyne Jones' chance right at the end. "The greatest thing about today was the crowd turned up and were great. There has been a bit of discontent around the place but they were fabulous from the first minute to the last minute."  West Bromwich Albion head coach Steve Clarke:  "It's a point we're happy with. It's a difficult place to come, we defended well and they didn't have many chances either. "The positives for us are that we have got a clean sheet and a hard-earned point away from home." "We have been in the top half of the table all season and we want to stay there. Qualifying for the Europa League is almost beyond us and to get there we would have to go above a number of good teams. That will be difficult."

24.04.2013 23:34:18 Reading edged closer to relegation as Norwich City scored two goals in the space of 90 seconds to take a big step towards Premier League survival. Ryan Bennett opened the scoring from eight yards after Royals keeper Alex McCarthy had denied Grant Holt. Norwich fans were still celebrating when Elliott Bennett made it 2-0 after McCarthy failed to deal with a cross. Garath McCleary scored a consolation for Reading, now 10 points from safety with four games left, from 18 yards. Confirmation of the Royals' relegation after one season in the top flight will be confirmed if Aston Villa win at Manchester United on Monday. This was their eighth defeat in nine games, and third in four matches since Nigel Adkins took over from Brian McDermott last month.  The visitors had enjoyed the better of the first half exchanges - McCleary going close from 18 yards before the same player drilled in a low cross which cannoned off Norwich defender Sebastien Bassong. But the spirit quickly drained away from the Premier League's bottom club after their season-long defensive problems once again surfaced. They had conceded 63 times in their previous 33 matches, and that total increased to 65 in less than two second-half minutes. Substitute Ryan Bennett, a first-half replacement for the injured Michael Turner, had failed to score for Norwich since joining from Peterborough 13 months ago. But the 23-year-old defender was well placed to drill the ball into the roof of the net in the 50th minute after McCarthy had beaten away an attempt by Holt. Norwich found themselves sucked into the battle to stay up after winning only one of their previous 16 league games. But Chris Hughton's side are now seven points clear of the relegation zone after Elliott Bennett pounced with a shot after McCarthy had failed to hold a 52nd minute cross. Canaries fans have endured some anxious moments in recent weeks and they were once again left feeling nervous when McCleary found the net 18 minutes from time. The former Nottingham Forest player rounded off a surging run with a tremendous finish from the edge of the box which beat keeper Mark Bunn for pace and power. The party atmosphere was replaced by one of nervous tension, but Reading failed to create any further clear-cut chances which would have capped another late fightback. Instead, Norwich will all but secure their Premier League safety if they overcome Stoke at the Britannia Stadium next Saturday. As for Reading, they could be relegated by the time they host Queens Park Rangers on 28 April.  Norwich manager Chris Hughton:  "We needed it. There are teams around us that are all capable of winning games. "How it will end up in the end, numbers wise, I don't know, but at the moment this feels like a big win for us. "I think it will take more points. I've always thought around that 40-mark and I think there are teams around us that are still very capable of winning games."  Reading boss Nigel Adkins:  "We can't hide away from the situation where we are in the league. I'm not going to do that." He added: "I thought we did well in the first half. Unfortunately when we came out in the second half, for a 10, 15-minute period, we didn't deal with the physicality of Norwich City. "To concede two goals so close together in the game, it effectively cost us the game."

24.04.2013 23:34:18 Nacho Monreal and Gervinho's second-half goals secured a hard-fought win for Arsenal at Swansea to boost their Champions League qualification hopes. Monreal scored his first Arsenal goal when he struck a low shot through a crowded penalty area into the bottom corner. Substitute Gervinho sealed the victory in stoppage time with a sharp finish. Michu had Swansea's best chance, as his team suffered their third home defeat of the season. Manager Arsene Wenger had described the game at the Liberty Stadium as    in Arsenal's quest to finish in the top four. But his side were rarely in danger, with Swansea not fully testing goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski, who was making his first league start in more than two years. Arsenal nearly had the perfect start when Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's curled effort rattled the crossbar after he had cut inside Angel Rangel. Full-back Rangel was then presented with an opportunity of his own when his advancing run was picked out by Ki Sung-Yueng. But with only Fabianski to beat, Rangel's first touch let him down and he fired wide with the outside of his right foot. Michu, scorer of three previous goals against Arsenal this season, was set up by Jonathan de Guzman after an error by Carl Jenkinson but his volley on the turn went narrowly wide. After a flurry of Swansea activity, neat build-up play by the visitors resulted in a chance for Santi Cazorla, whose dipping volley forced Michel Vorm into his first save of the match. Cazorla's chance was the start of a good spell for Arsenal but the Swansea defence held firm and Ashley Williams blocked Theo Walcott's goal-bound effort. On the counter Michu continued to prove a danger and Fabianksi had to dive low to deny him, although the assistant referee had already flagged for offside. With the rain lashing, Oxlade-Chamberlain again came close when his swerving shot from 25 yards clipped the top of the crossbar three minutes before the break. This was the fourth meeting of the season between the sides and Swansea were looking to complete a league double over the Gunners having won 2-0 at Emirates Stadium in December.  But Arsenal started the second half brightly and Cazorla's shot from the edge of the penalty area was well gathered by Vorm. Swansea were restricted to speculative efforts and Michu failed to trouble Fabianski with an effort that flew over the crossbar while compatriot Pablo Hernandez fired wide. Arsenal stepped up the pressure and the deadlock was finally broken by January recruit Monreal.  The Spaniard pounced to lash a shot across Vorm into the bottom corner with the help of a deflection off Williams. Gervinho wrapped up the victory after fellow substitute Aaron Ramsey's pass, firing low beyond Vorm and bringing Arsenal within two points of fourth-placed Chelsea.  Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger: "We will know at the end of the season how important this win is, but we knew as well the win was absolutely vital for us and we could not drop points today. "We have shown we are up for the fight and we will do so until the end of the season. The attitude of the players was outstanding, even when our legs were less than fresh after playing in midweek. "We kept going and refused to drop points. The players knew what was expected."  Swansea City manager Michael Laudrup: "I think in the first half we saw some good football from both sides. "Our philosophies are similar and they had a couple of chances with Chamberlain hitting the bar, we had some good chances too. "In the second half there was less good football. There was a lot of play in midfield but no shots on target. "I thought it would be 0-0, but when things are like that the first goal will decide the game and that is what happened, it was a strange goal, but it was a goal and that decided the game."

24.04.2013 23:34:18 Everton manager David Moyes celebrated 11 years in charge as his 10-man side all but ended Manchester City's already-slim title chances. The hosts had a Kevin Mirallas goal disallowed before Leon Osman smashed home a superb 30-yard curling effort. City could not respond despite Steven Pienaar's dismissal following a booking for a studs-up tackle on the hour. The visitors had a strong penalty claim turned down late on but Everton sealed the win through Nikica Jelavic's shot. Substitute Jelavic's superb breakaway injury-time effort rounded off a perfect afternoon and fully deserved win for the home side and manager Moyes following a difficult week. Last Saturday's home humiliation against Wigan in the FA Cup and the uncertainty surrounding Moyes's future was soon forgotten thanks to a memorable performance full of spirit, passion and quality. City, who are now 12 points behind Premier League leaders Manchester United having played a game more, will justifiably feel they should have had a penalty when Marouane Fellaini blocked a late Carlos Tevez strike with his hands in the box - but a free-kick was instead given outside the area. However, the hosts were the better side throughout, despite a frantic finale in which goalkeeper Jan Mucha made several fine saves. A City side missing the considerable midfield presence of Yaya Toure, who had a migraine, were second best from the outset and never look comfortable playing with three centre-backs. Everton's Osman and Darron Gibson dominated the City midfield and continually exploited the gaps the system left on either flank. The ever-impressive Leighton Baines saw less of the ball on the left but always looked likely to tee up a goal, while the excellent Seamus Coleman struggled to find a telling cross despite a barnstorming first-half display. Everton's early superiority was almost rewarded when Mirallas had the ball in the net. However it was wiped out for offside, even though it appeared he was level as he smashed the ball into the near post after adjusting his feet brilliantly 15 yards from goal. City finally mustered a couple of tame efforts on goal by Edin Dzeko and Tevez just after the 20-minute mark. But Everton were still on top and deservedly went ahead when Osman crashed the ball into the net from distance. The midfielder ran onto Coleman's pass inside and cut across the ball that left England colleague Joe Hart almost motionless. Mancini responded by switching to a 4-4-2 system and City immediately posed more of a threat. Tevez fizzed a long-range effort and Dzeko was unable to leap high enough to get a headed chance on target. Their improvement continued after the break and their chances of keeping alive their fading title dreams appeared good when Pienaar was sent off for a second yellow card following a nasty looking challenge on Javi Garcia. But although City did create opportunities, their performance remained unconvincing and disjointed and Mucha's saves were all steady rather than spectacular. Dzeko's delicate flick set up Tevez but Mucha, making just his second Premier League start in his three seasons with the club, kept out the Argentine's shot and then reacted well to save the follow-up from James Milner. Pablo Zabaleta forced another fine save from the on-rushing Slovakian keeper but City should have had the chance of a penalty to open the scoring. Fellaini blocked a Tevez strike with his hand but referee Lee Probert awarded a free-kick. And within minutes Jelavic made it 2-0 on the counter-attack to take Everton back up to fifth spot in the table and ensure Moyes could celebrate his anniversary in charge in style. A flowing move saw Fellaini find Jelavic who brilliantly curled the ball past Hart for his first goal this year and seal a fourth consecutive win over City at Goodison Park.  Everton manager David Moyes:  "I would have been disappointed if we hadn't responded [to last week's defeat against Wigan] and surprised if we hadn't. The players played great. We were playing the champions of England and I thought we gave them a right good run for their money. "What you saw is what Everton do. I thought we played really well in the first half and I thought in the second half, when we were down to 10 men, we did what Everton did 11 years ago when I took over. "We were resilient, hard to beat, made sure the opposition didn't score, threw ourselves on the line for the team. We were rubbish last week but we have been good all season and you are watching a really good Everton side. "It is just to make sure people realise we have not gone away. We are still there. I think people last week thought we had gone away. "I think the sending-off is a terrible decision. The boy rolls about three times and there is hardly any contact. I thought it was the wrong decision."

24.04.2013 23:34:19 A late penalty winner kept Liverpool's faint hopes of gatecrashing the top four alive as they beat Tottenham. The Reds went ahead when Luis Suarez stabbed in after a slick move. Spurs hit back through a Jan Vertonghen header and the Belgian then fired the visitors in front with a 15-yard shot. But a poor Kyle Walker backpass allowed Stewart Downing to drive in a Reds leveller before Steven Gerrard netted the winner with a spot-kick after Benoit Assou-Ekotto fouled Suarez. Spurs were authors of their own downfall as two late defensive mistakes contributed to their first defeat in 13 league games. The White Hart Lane club stay third but this result will give the teams below them - including north London rivals Arsenal - hope that Andre Villas-Boas's side can be caught, especially given the way they faded towards the end of last season. Spurs endured a spell of just six points from a possible 27 during last year's run-in, which ultimately cost them a Champions League place. For Liverpool, this was a first victory of the season over a team currently in the top eight and lifts them to sixth, but they remain outsiders for a top-four spot. They are seven points behind fourth-placed Chelsea, who also have a game in hand on the Merseysiders. The Reds are the Premier League's leading scorers since the turn of the year with 25 goals and they quickly got into the attacking mode that has become a feature of their recent performances. It was the home side who exerted the pressure in the opening stages, although a dipping 30-yard Gareth Bale free-kick was nervously swatted away by Reds keeper Brad Jones, playing in place of the injured Pepe Reina. Liverpool's high work-rate and fluid movement stretched Spurs and the hosts duly took the lead with a well-worked goal. Coutinho produced some lovely skill on the left wing before combining with marauding left-back Jose Enrique, who slipped a pass through for Suarez to stab neatly inside Lloris's near post with the outside of his boot. Suarez threatened again when he latched on to a Steven Gerrard pass and when his shot from a tight angle was parried by Spurs' French keeper, the Reds felt they should have had a penalty after full-back Walker tugged Coutinho as he tried to get to the rebound. Bale had been contained by Liverpool and overshadowed by Suarez but, after shooting high following a surging run, the Welshman made his presence felt when he crossed for Vertonghen to beat right-back Glen Johnson to the ball and head home on the stroke of half-time. The goal lifted the visitors and they added a second shortly after the break as Bale and Vertonghen combined again to undo Liverpool. Bale delivered a free-kick that the Reds failed to clear, and centre-back Vertonghen showed a striker's prowess to drive home the loose ball. Spurs were now overwhelming their hosts but failed to take a key chance to go two ahead. Gylfi Sigurdsson was found at the far post by Bale only to see his shot deflected off Jones against the outside of the upright. The miss looked more costly when Walker's inadvertent backpass was missed by Lloris as he rushed out to meet it and Downing pounced to drive a low shot through the legs of Vertonghen. Spurs striker Jermain Defoe then put his side in trouble again when he inexplicably played a ball into his own area for Suarez, who went down under Assou-Ekotto's shove. Gerrard stepped up to send Lloris the wrong way from the spot and move Liverpool above Everton.  Tottenham manager Andre Villas-Boas: "It is difficult for us to take because we did ever so well to come back into the game in the first half and we started brightly in the second half. "We lost control of the game when things looked to be going our way, which was more down to a couple of mistakes we did rather than to Liverpool's merit - although they worked very hard. "Hopefully, this setback can serve as an example to move forward."

24.04.2013 23:34:19 Papiss Cisse scored a stoppage-time winner as Newcastle came from behind for the third straight home Premier League game to deservedly beat Stoke. After a lacklustre first half and against the run of play, Chieck Tiote clattered Jonathan Walters in the box and he converted the spot kick. But some poor Stoke defending allowed Newcastle to hit straight back through Yohan Cabaye's well-placed free-kick. Cisse then secured the points with a close-range finish at the death. The Senegal striker, unmarked and played onside by Marc Wilson, controlled Sylvain Marveaux's cross before drilling past Asmir Begovic. His last-gasp strike made it four wins in six league games for the resurgent Magpies and moved them up to 13th in the table. They can now focus on Thursday's Europa League last-16 second leg against Anzhi Makhachkala and Sunday's trip to Wigan with fresh optimism. Stoke, by contrast, own the top-flight's worst record in 2013 - they have lost seven of their last nine games and have only one victory in 10. This was a golden chance for the Potters to secure a second away win of the season, but they were undermined by uncharacteristic defensive lapses. For so long their game plan of keeping tight at the back before launching counter-attacks when possible was working well. A Newcastle side featuring seven changes from that which started at Anzhi in midweek dominated possession and territory, but rarely carried the cutting edge required to open the scoring. Cabaye and Jonas Gutierrez fired wide, while at the other end Stoke were furious that referee Andre Marriner opted against penalising Davide Santon when he appeared to trip Ryan Shotton on the edge of the area. Yoan Gouffran had the best chance to break the deadlock, only to loop his finish over the bar after being picked out by Cabaye. A similar pattern emerged in the second half - the hosts passed and probed, the visitors defended stoutly and launched the occasional foray forward. Tiote brilliantly released Sissoko, the midfielder taking a heavy touch under pressure from Begovic, but his afternoon then took a turn for the worse. The Ivory Coast international raced back to help contain a Stoke break, only to completely mistime his challenge on Walters inside the box. Walters, who scored two own-goals and missed a penalty against Chelsea in January, stepped up to wrong-foot Rob Elliot and find the bottom corner. However, any hope they had of an away win were quickly distinguished when Glenn Whelan almost played in Gouffran and the ball fell to Sissoko, who was fouled on the edge of the box. From the resulting set-piece, Cabaye left a diving Begovic with little chance as his curling effort cannoned off the bar and over the line. A draw seemed inevitable, but Cisse intervened.  Newcastle manager Alan Pardew:  "It's difficult to quantify [how important it is]. It was a tight game. Stoke were excellent. Every question we asked they had an answer for. We were a bit tired in our minds in the first half, not sharp in our thinking. "They got a goal you sensed may have come, they had a couple of penalty shouts before that. But our quick response was key to victory - it was a fantastic goal by Yohan. "We changed from the bench. Marveaux pops up with an eye-of-the-needle pass for Papiss to win it for us. It's a massive win. We go home in a much different situation than we would have been if it hadn't gone in. "It sets us up lovely for Thursday in the Europa League. We've got a great European night at St James' Park to look forward to. It definitely gives us a chance to look at the top 10, where we should be."  Stoke manager Tony Pulis:  "It's disappointing after going in front and really restricting Newcastle. I don't think Asmir [Begovic] had a shot to save. "The first goal is a dreadful mistake from us, the second is onside, but Cisse could easily be off the pitch. He raised his hands twice - he pushed Wilo [Andy Wilkinson] and then he slapped Ryan [Shawcross]. "That's disappointing and the fact the we could have had a penalty in the first half. But that's been our season. Away from home we've played better than at any time in our five years in the Premier League, we've been in more games, we just haven't been able to get over the line. "The lads will keep going. We're desperately disappointed because it's happened so many times this season, it just seems to be one of those seasons that irrespective of what we do we just can't get over the line."

24.04.2013 23:34:19 Artur Boruc saved a controversial injury-time penalty from Grant Holt as Southampton secured a point at Norwich. With the match heading for a low-key draw, referee Mark Clattenburg awarded the hosts a spot-kick when Luke Shaw tripped Holt as he ran out of the box. Southampton were furious but Boruc dived to his right to save the penalty. The visitors had earlier created the better chances, with Adam Lallana, Gaston Ramirez, Rickie Lambert and Jay Rodriguez all failing to capitalise. A point was the least they deserved for their endeavours, but it was almost taken away from them when Clattenburg pointed to the sport. Javier Garrido's long ball forward bounced through to the right and, as Holt and Shaw ran to retrieve it, they collided and a penalty was given. Clattenburg ignored Southampton's protests, consulted with his assistant and maintained his stance - only for Boruc to provide a final twist. It was a dramatic end to an otherwise unspectacular encounter, not too dissimilar to their 1-1 draw at St Mary's in November. As recently as three seasons ago this match was a League One fixture, and in the opening stages the quality of football on display was certainly some way off top-flight standard. The players were not helped by cold, wet and occasionally snowy conditions at a subdued Carrow Road, but perhaps a lack of confidence from recent results was the more significant factor. While Norwich could lay claim to only one victory from their previous 11 Premier League games, Southampton had managed just one in six since Mauricio Pochettino succeeded Nigel Adkins as manager. But as the half progressed space began to emerge and the visitors utilised their extra man in midfield to probe for an opener. Chris Hughton's decision to hand striker Kei Kamara his first Norwich start alongside Holt in a 4-4-2 formation enabled Southampton, who opted for a 4-5-1 structure, to create a string of chances. Inspired by the attack-minded triumvirate of Lallana, Ramirez and Lambert, Saints twice threatened to break the deadlock before Lallana's drive was tipped over by Mark Bunn. Bunn made an even better save to keep out a Ramirez chip after he was put through by Lambert - and it was that let-off which finally appeared to spur Norwich into life. Robert Snodgrass tested Boruc with a swerving free-kick before a sliding Holt failed to connect with a low Snodgrass cross, although it seemed he was being pulled back by Shaw. Michael Turner headed narrowly wide as Norwich reached half-time on top, which with Southampton still looking to attack at every opportunity made for a potentially exciting second period. And so it proved as Lallana shot over following Javier Garrido's poor clearance and Maya Yoshida slid in brilliantly to intercept a Snodgrass cross with Holt waiting to pounce. Rodriguez was denied by Bunn and Lambert wasted the follow-up, while Yoshida again arrived with impeccable timing as Snodgrass latched on to Wes Hoolahan's pass and rounded Boruc. Then came Clattenburg's contentious call, but Boruc had the final word.  Norwich manager Chris Hughton:  "The lad pulled off a very good save. That was out first penalty this season. It would have been nice. "Grant has done well and got ball side of the defender. There's certainly contact there - whether there's enough for a penaltyâ¦ If anything, we had an even better shout in the first half towards the end. "In some ways it balances out. It hasn't done for us this season - that was our first penalty - but today it has. Over 90 minutes I thought we had the better chances. Robert Snodgrass had the best chance of the game. "It was a typical game at this stage of the season - both teams fighting very hard. We've got a couple of tough away games now and we'll try to get something from them."  Southampton manager Mauricio Pochettino:  "From seeing it on the pitch I thought it wasn't a penalty. The ball was heading out towards the corner. Luke Shaw was running after ball and his rival clatters into him. Upon seeing the review on TV it's super clear to me it's not a penalty at all. "Artur was phenomenal in saving that penalty. There's an old saying in foot - if you can't win, you shouldn't lose and that's what happened today. We didn't deserve to lose. "What was said on the pitch [to Mark Clattenburg] stays on the pitch, I fully respect referees. I understand they have a job to do but also me and the staff have a job to do as well. It's a moment where everything is very tense and self-rhythm is very high. "What is clear for me over 90 minutes is that we deserved to win, but looking at the goal at the end at least we saved a point."

24.04.2013 23:34:19 A stirring QPR performance helped their Premier League survival hopes, while heightening a beaten Sunderland's own relegation fears. The Black Cats took the lead when striker Steven Fletcher turned in a low Adam Johnson cross. But Loic Remy pounced on a fortunate deflection to deservedly equalise by angling in a shot past Simon Mignolet. Andros Townsend scored with a 22-yard strike and Jermaine Jenas added a third late on to seal the three points. The scenes of joy at the final whistle illustrated a renewed sense of optimism at QPR, while the performance provided evidence of a defensive resilience allied to a new-found ability to score goals. The R's had four points from 13 games when manager Harry Redknapp took over but have since collected 19 from 16 games and, while they remain bottom of the table and four points from safety, the belief that they can avoid relegation is growing. Victory saw QPR achieve back-to-back top-flight wins for the the first time since December 1995 and, more importantly, made the relegation picture look a good deal tighter. Sunderland will certainly be looking over their shoulder. Having not won in six league games they are now only six points from the relegation zone. For the home side, in the week the club announced financial results showing debts of Â£89m, the pressure to avoid relegation was clearer than ever. Nevertheless, Rangers, and Junior Hoilett in particular, did not let this inhibit them. The winger jinked his way into the area before angling a shot a whisker wide and was soon on the attack again, cutting inside and hitting a shot that again swerved wide. The visitors had struggled to work any chances in the opening 20 minutes but stunned Loftus Road when Fletcher scored from a swift counter-attack for his 11th goal of the season. Townsend's free-kick for the hosts was spilled by Black Cats keeper Mignolet, and after Titus Bramble cleared upfield, Stephane Sessegnon found Johnson, who drilled a ball in for Fletcher to turn home from six yards. If that was harsh on QPR, they had a slice of fortune to thank for their equaliser, when Townsend's shot deflected off defender John O'Shea straight into the path of Remy, who sidefooted in for his third goal in five games. It was QPR's first league goal at Loftus Road since Boxing Day and the team with the worst home goalscoring record in the Premier League soon threatened more. Zamora cushioned a header into the path of Remy but he volleyed wildly over, before Stephane Mbia had a long-range shot gathered at the second attempt by Mignolet. QPR had failed to replicate their first-half form after the interval but Townsend, a January loan signing from Tottenham, sparked them back into life when he put the home side in front with 20 minutes to go. The midfielder chested down a clearance and half-volleyed a dipping shot into the top corner out of Mignolet's reach. Substitute Jenas, another January arrival from Spurs, completed the west London side's victory when he produced a scorching shot to beat Mignolet in the final minute.  Sunderland manager Martin O'Neill: "We need to start winning, really. I think next week [against Norwich] is a big, big game for us. "We have difficult fixtures coming up, including Norwich. We have our work cut out. We have known that since the start of the season. "It has been tough going throughout the season and we have to fight through these last nine games."

24.04.2013 23:34:19 Aston Villa breathed new life into their Premier League survival bid, coming from behind at Reading to snatch only their second league win of 2013. Gabriel Agbonlahor's thunderous volley on half-time lifts Paul Lambert's side three points clear of the bottom three, with nine league games remaining. Reading had snatched the lead after 31 minutes when Villa defender Nathan Baker sliced beyond his own goalkeeper. Christian Benteke hit back immediately, before Agbonlahor won it for Villa. This was a crucial result for Villa, whose last away win came on 15 December at Anfield and who had won just one of their previous 11 matches. But, having won this encounter, forthcoming home matches against Queens Park Rangers and Liverpool can be viewed with renewed hope. For Reading, the outlook is altogether more bleak. This was a fourth consecutive league defeat for Brian McDermott's side and at the final whistle the frustration was evident among the home support. The tension, on both sides, was apparent from the off as shots flew wide and passes went astray. Andreas Weimann had the best of the early opportunities, only to shoot wide with the goal at his mercy, while Adam Le Fondre might have done better for Reading with a header at the back post. The game burst into life shortly after the half-hour mark with two goals in a breathless 60-second period. Reading struck first, snatching the lead when the unfortunate Baker turned Jobi McAnuff's low cross into his own net but Benteke struck back immediately for Villa, his deflected shot beating goalkeeper Stuart Taylor after a delightful surge down the right by Weimann. It was a moment that robbed the home faithful of their chance to celebrate and brought belief flooding back to Villa. And as half-time approached, the visitors' growing confidence produced another goal. Agbonlahor gathered Taylor's half-hearted clearance and unleashed an unstoppable left-footed shot that flashed into the goal from eight yards after Barry Bannan had diverted a shot onto the post. The goal stunned Reading, who left the field to boos from their own supporters, but McDermott's side never go down without a fight. They had the ball in the net just before the hour mark - Noel Hunt turning McAnuff's low cross into the net only for the linesman to flag for offside - and continued to push hard. No Premier League team has conceded more in the second half of games than Villa - while Reading have scored more Premier League goals in the final 15 minutes than any other side. The home side went close through Hal Robson-Kanu, whose left-foot shot fizzed narrowly wide, before Le Fondre failed to make the most of a chance to head at goal. McDermott threw on substitutes Garath McCleary and Nick Blackman and Reading created two clear chances for Robson-Kanu. He side-footed the first wide from the penalty spot after controlling the ball on his chest and then headed straight at Guzan when perfectly picked out by McAnuff's cross. Blackman also went down in the area late on to spark penalty appeals from the Royals manager, while Agbonlahor might have wrapped up the points for Villa with a curled effort that drifted just wide.

24.04.2013 23:34:19 Romelu Lukaku continued his good form as West Brom beat Swansea to move up to seventh in the Premier League. Luke Moore gave visitors Swansea an early lead with a well-taken header before Lukaku scored at the near post. The Belgian then missed a penalty, yet the Baggies moved in front when Jonathan de Guzman scored an own goal. Swansea responded and thought they had earned a point but substitute Roland Lamah had a goal controversially ruled out for offside late on. Lamah surged into the West Brom box and had the ball in the net after his cross cannoned back to him. But referee Lee Mason decided that it came back off a Swansea team-mate as he tucked in, meaning he was offside as he scored, even though replays showed that the ball hit West Brom's Gareth McAuley and Ben Foster before returning to the Belgian. It was a stroke of fortune for Steve Clarke's team, who weathered a late storm from the Swans, but the Baggies were rewarded for an improved display after the break as they overtook their opponents in the table. The result ends West Brom's run of three straight defeats against Swansea and puts them within four points of fifth-placed Arsenal, who have a game in hand. And after another strong performance by Lukaku, they can certainly put pressure on teams around them such as Everton, Liverpool and Swansea. Michael Laudrup's side have already qualified for the Europa League next season, by virtue of their Capital One Cup success. Yet after a week where the Dane signed a new contract keeping him at the club until 2015, the finale to this encounter left him with a sour taste in his mouth. Before Moore's smartly-taken header, his team should already have led but Michu, so often their saviour this season, wasted two decent openings during a period in which the Swans were in total control. It took 10 minutes for the hosts to gain any sort of coherent possession, and it wasn't until the half-hour mark when they managed their first chance, Chris Brunt firing over from the angle. Moments later, though, Swansea went ahead. Ben Davies' cross was deflected for a corner, and Moore held off Claudio Yacob to guide his header in from De Guzman's corner for his second goal in two games. With little to cheer in the first period, the home supporters were becoming understandably anxious as West Brom's midfield failed to support Lukaku. And when the equaliser came it was out of the blue as Brunt flicked on Ben Foster's clearance, Graham Dorrans crossed first time, and the striker, on loan from Chelsea, finished at the near post for his 13th goal of the season. The hosts improved after the break and should have gone ahead when referee Lee Mason pointed to the spot after Wayne Routledge's trip on James Morrison. Unfortunately for Clarke's team, Lukaku's spot-kick was poor, Michel Vorm diving easily to his right to make the save. Although Michu has been the headline-grabber for Swansea this season, midfielder De Guzman - on loan from Villarreal - has been one of the key supporting acts, yet his part in the game's third goal was one he will wish to forget. McAuley headed towards goal from a corner, but although Angel Rangel headed off the line, it cannoned into the goal off the Dutchman. Sensing defeat, Laudrup made a host of substitutions, but Michu again fired off-target following Nathan Dyer's lay-off. Lamah then looked like he had earned a point as the Swansea fans celebrated but he was denied by the assistant referee's flag three minutes from the end.  Swansea boss Michael Laudrup: "Football is about emotions and all that. You are up and down in 90 minutes and you talk about decisions made by the referee, but it's a part of the game. "What makes me frustrated is when you see our disallowed goal. We are not talking about a decision, we are talking about the rules of football. "When the ball comes back not off one player, but two, it cannot be offside. It's like giving offside from a throw-in. It's frustrating."  West Brom boss Steve Clarke  on Swansea's disallowed goal: "I've got to agree with Michael Laudrup. If you look at it, it last came off Ben Foster, which means the fellow is not offside. "We were fortunate on that one, but the effort we put in, sometimes you get your luck and we earned it. "[The defeat in November] was something in our minds. We went down there on the back of a good run and they turned us over, so for us to play like we did today, we showed that on our day we can match anybody in the Premier League."

24.04.2013 23:34:19 Manchester City closed the gap on leaders Manchester United to 12 points with victory at Aston Villa, who remain in the Premier League relegation zone. The game's key moment came in first-half injury time as Ciaran Clark's failed attempt to turn Edin Dzeko saw the defender robbed of the ball. The Bosnian selflessly played in Carlos Tevez to round Brad Guzan and score. City took charge after the break and came closest to doubling their lead when Yaya Toure struck the post. Roberto Mancini's side thrashed Villa 5-0 at Etihad Stadium in November but there was no sign of any such disparity in the early stages as the hosts threatened with a number of dangerous crosses towards giant striker Christian Benteke. One such delivery saw Tevez, in the City starting line-up for injured compatriot    clear off the line as Charles N'Zogbia's in-swinging corner was met with a powerful header by Benteke. The visitors finally began to exert control after midfielder Jack Rodwell was forced off with his latest injury set-back, to be replaced by Dzeko, and Yaya Toure was dropped back to provide a commanding presence at the base of the City midfield. The champions began to gain more possession, and an intricate move involving David Silva produced a fingertip save from Villa goalkeeper Guzan, the American pushing full-back Pablo Zabaleta's goal-bound shot on to the post. Villa looked on course to finish the first half on level terms until a disastrous mistake from centre-back Clark ended with Tevez opening the scoring. As the visiting players celebrated, Villa's stand-in captain protested he had been fouled by the Bosnian and replays seemed to back up his argument, though the 23-year-old had shown his inexperience by attempting to play his way out from the back when a simple clearance was required. The error typified a frailty in defence that has been apparent throughout Villa's now 17-game run without a clean sheet in all competitions.  Clark's mistake was repeated by Matthew Lowton after the break as Dzeko dispossessed the full-back on the edge of the Villa penalty area. He picked out Tevez once more but, crucially, Lowton was able to get back and block the Argentine's effort with Guzan beaten. Villa's best hope of an equaliser was on the counter-attack and a quick break saw centre-back Kolo Toure produce a fine defensive header to deny Gabriel Agbonlahor. But that was a rare foray forward for the hosts and Yaya Toure came close to doubling the lead when he hit the base of the post with a curled effort from the edge of the box. Dzeko fired the rebound into the roof of the net but his effort was rightly ruled out for offside. Urged on by the home support, Villa tried to build some pressure as the game entered its final stages. Their feebleness in attack, however, was summed up by a sliced corner from Lowton two minutes into injury time that went straight out for a goal kick. A further blow was to follow as midfielder Fabian Delph, an industrious presence against City, picked up his 10th booking of the season and will now miss Villa's crucial games against relegation rivals Reading and Queens Park Rangers.  Aston Villa boss Paul Lambert:  "I thought we were well in the game. The goal is a mistake. I wouldn't have minded if someone had put one in the top corner with a bit of skill. "But it's a mistake by us. It is easy to be critical of Ciaran. The lad has been excellent all season. He will learn from it, he won't make the same mistake again."  Manchester City boss Roberto Mancini:  "I think the performance was difficult as Aston Vila are a good team, it is strange they are at the bottom. "It was important to get a clean sheet and the win. We had four or five incredible chances to score and their keeper saved everything. "When Edin Dzeko plays like tonight, fighting for every ball, I like it. He could be important."

24.04.2013 23:34:19 Tottenham won a pulsating north London derby to go third in the league and seven points ahead of Arsenal. Gareth Bale and Aaron Lennon slotted in two carbon copy goals in three first-half minutes after defence-splitting passes to put Spurs in control. It was Bale's ninth goal in seven games but Per Mertesacker's header went in off the Welshman to give Arsenal hope. Bale skied a far-post chance before Arsenal's Aaron Ramsey almost equalised but drove a shot just wide. Entertainment and goals are almost guaranteed between these two sides and there was no shortage of either in an enthralling contest at White Hart Lane. Tottenham's failure to take a number of glorious chances to wrap up the game as Arsenal desperately chased an equaliser only added to the drama. But the home side held on after enduring six minutes of added time to go 12 league games unbeaten and, in the process, leapfrog Chelsea as well as move two points behind second-placed Manchester City. The wizardry of Spurs winger Bale has swept all before him this year and he was again on the scoresheet as he took his tally to 20 goals for the season. The Gunners paid the price for a serious lapse of concentration towards the end of the first half, with their determined efforts after the break not enough to retrieve the situation. Arsenal's next game will see them try to overturn a 3-1 first leg deficit in a last-16 Champions League tie at Bayern Munich and, if they do go out, the loss at Spurs leaves them five points from a top four spot and struggling to qualify for Europe's top competition. There had been a huge sense of anticipation around the game and that transformed itself into an intensity and urgency on the pitch in the fevered atmosphere of a game between these rivals. In the frenetic opening skirmishes, the Gunners almost picked their way through when Santi Cazorla's incisive pass released Olivier Giroud, whose shot was blocked by the sliding recovery tackle of Jan Vertonghen. Arsenal were tigerish and tenacious but the promise of their attacks was continually snuffed out by the excellent Tottenham centre-backs Vertonghen and Michael Dawson. They produced the resilience and awareness the visitors could have done with from their defence, who were twice caught out to give Spurs the upper hand. Gylfi Sigurdsson and Scott Parker each played incisive passes from the left through the heart of Arsenal's defence for Bale and Lennon to score. Bale sent a 38th-minute left-foot shot into the bottom corner before Lennon rounded Wojciech Szczesny and slotted in his fourth goal of the campaign. Spurs had led 1-0 and 2-0 against their rivals in their past two meetings but ended up losing both 5-2 and Arsenal threatened another comeback when Mertesacker's glanced header from Theo Walcott's free-kick skimmed in off Bale's head. Spurs keeper Hugo Lloris crucially gathered a low Carl Jenkinson cross as Giroud and Aaron Ramsey threatened to pounce before Spurs took back a grip on the fluctuating game. Bale blazed over a Benoit Assou-Ekotto cross from the left before Sigurdsson was clean through only to square the ball for Mertesacker to clear instead of shooting. The visitors were exposed as they piled forward and Defoe sent a shot agonisingly wide as the home side again failed to put Arsenal away. Spurs were almost punished when Ramsey angled an effort wide, while Walcott curled a 22-yard free-kick the wrong side of the post towards the end. Tottenham will feel they are strongly placed for a top four spot but there will also be a note of caution after they let a 10 point lead over Arsenal slip last season.

24.04.2013 23:34:19 Stoke City took a big step towards survival with a rare away win that all but sealed Queens Park Rangers' fate. The visitors took the lead just before half-time when Peter Crouch converted Cameron Jerome's cut-back. And Jon Walters sealed the win from the penalty spot after Clint Hill had impeded Crouch. Stoke moved up to 15th place, six points clear of the drop zone, while QPR will be relegated on Monday if Aston Villa beat Manchester United. Livewire striker Loic Remy apart, QPR looked a disjointed unit in a match which provided ample evidence as to why they are in such a dire predicament. Too often players shot when they should have passed and vice versa, while in conceding the opening goal shortly before the break the home side reprised a habit that has cost them points up and down the country. Stoke had entered the match on a desperate run that had seen them slip into relegation contention, but Crouch's opener injected much-needed confidence into their play and they comfortably held on for a first away victory since 1 December. With Stoke pressing from the off, a QPR side showing five changes from the one beaten 2-0 at Everton last weekend looked to threaten on the counter-attack with Adel Taarabt finding space between the visitors' midfield and defence. The Moroccan almost shaved the post with two early long-range strikes then ignored well-placed team-mates to his left and right before blazing wastefully wide. Stoke's attacks regularly carried promise but too often broke down due to a lack of guile and poise in and around the penalty area. Nonetheless, they were almost gifted an opener when Rob Green fumbled Walters's shot and looked on in relief as the ball bounced away to safety. Green fared rather better when called into action to keep out a fierce long-range half-volley from Crouch that was destined for the top corner. Just as they had against Everton, QPR fell behind just before half-time. Marc Wilson dispossessed Andros Townsend and fed Jerome, who eluded Chris Samba with some neat footwork and pulled the ball back for Crouch to put away only his second goal since September. Samba almost levelled before the break as his hooked effort from a right-wing free-kick drifted fractionally wide of the far post. With four goals in his previous six starts, Remy represented QPR's best hope and the Frenchman almost delivered an equaliser when he wriggled past a couple of Stoke defenders inside the box and fired a left-footed shot that was well saved by Asmir Begovic, diving to his left. From the resulting corner, Samba's goal-bound effort was unwittingly kept out by team-mate Stephane Mbia. With gaps opening up in the QPR backline, Stoke came close to making it 2-0. Steven N'Zonzi's cross from the left found its way to Charlie Adam at the far post, but the Scot's cushioned effort looped over the bar. It was no surprise when the second goal arrived 15 minutes before full-time. After Robert Huth's header had struck a post, Crouch was pulled down by Hill as he looked to convert the rebound and referee Chris Foy pointed to the spot. Walters, who had missed two of his previous four penalties this season, was forced to take his effort twice because of encroaching players but held his nerve to drill the ball into the bottom corner. QPR fashioned little by way of response and must surely now start planning for life in the Championship next season.  Stoke manager Tony Pulis:  "They are very good on the break and we got caught four or five times. It was great for Peter to score before half-time and in the second half we tightened up and were a lot better. "It takes a bit of pressure off but there is still pressure there and the four games we'll play are very tough games. "40 points will be enough because we have good goal difference. There is still work to be done. A win or three draws, I don't care how we cook it."

24.04.2013 23:34:19 Luis Suarez scored a hat-trick as Liverpool thrashed Wigan and boosted their hopes of European qualification. Brazil's Philippe Coutinho was integral to the first two goals, crossing for Stewart Downing to head in from close range before playing in Suarez, who slotted past keeper Ali Al Habsi. The Uruguay forward made it 3-0 before the break with a deflected free-kick before he poked in his third. Emmerson Boyce and Franco Di Santo were denied by great saves from Pepe Reina. Liverpool's Spanish keeper, renowned as a superb shot-stopper, excelled himself with a glorious clawed save to prevent Boyce's spectacular effort from finding the top corner before tipping over Di Santo's point-blank header. Had either of those first-half efforts gone in, the Latics might have had hopes of fighting their way back into the match, but this was Liverpool's day as manager Brendan Rodgers saw his side follow up their 5-0 win over Swansea with an equally dominant victory at the DW Stadium. The result leaves the Reds only five points behind fifth-placed Arsenal. The Gunners play their game in hand at Spurs on Sunday. For their part, the hosts missed a chance to move clear of 18th-placed Aston Villa. Instead they remain a single point above the Midlands side, who are at home to Manchester City on Monday. Downing began the rout with only his second league goal for Liverpool when he leapt to nod in from close range after a brilliant jinking run by Coutinho. The South American pair of Coutinho and Suarez quickly established a good understanding and duly combined for the second goal. The Brazilian caused panic among the home defence before stabbing a pass through to Suarez, who took the sting off the ball and slotted expertly past goalkeeper Al Habsi. Seconds after the restart, more cracks began to show in the Wigan defence as team-mates Boyce and James McArthur squared up to each other after Suarez had been played in on goal following a poor backpass. And the Latics day went from bad to worse when Suarez added a third when his free-kick came off the head of Shaun Maloney and crept inside the far post. The Latics conceded the fourth shortly after the restart when England full-back Glen Johnson produced one of his trademark surges down the right and played in Suarez, who poked his shot through the legs of Al Habsi. Any realistic hopes of revival had passed, but Wigan still created chances with Reina yet again coming to Liverpool's rescue - pushing away Paul Scharner's header and preventing Arouna Kone from getting a touch on a cross that flew across his goal. Liverpool's pressure eased in the last half-hour, and they created just one more opportunity when substitute Henderson had his header cleared off the line by James McCarthy.  Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers:  "This was a place that's been very difficult to win at - it's been a number of years. "Roberto [Martinez] has done an outstanding job and everyone understands it's a very tricky place to come. "Our defensive organisation was very good and we're very pleased to score goals. [Suarez] is a real pleasure to work with. Every week I stand talking superlatives, but his biggest attribute is humility. He never looks for a lazy day and is the first out on the training pitch every day, which is why he's so special to his team-mates. "[Coutinho] is young but has played over 100 games and a lot of them have been at the top level. He owns the ball, he was born with the ball at his feet."

24.04.2013 23:34:19 Chelsea interim manager Rafael Benitez ended a turbulent week with the satisfaction of victory as West Bromwich Albion were beaten at Stamford Bridge. Benitez's strained relationship with Chelsea's supporters appeared to reach breaking point after he publicly rounded on those who had been criticising him after Wednesday's 2-0 FA Cup fifth-round win at Middlesbrough.  The Spaniard insisted he will stay in charge until the end of his contract in May despite describing the decision to hand him his interim title as "a massive mistake" - and Demba Ba's first-half goal offered some relief by putting Chelsea back in third place in the Premier League. Despite fears Benitez could be the subject of increased hostility following his outburst, the atmosphere inside Stamford Bridge was relatively calm as Chelsea secured a win that was more convincing than the narrow scoreline suggested. Chelsea's fans still made their feelings towards Benitez clear with the familiar chants and banners unflatteringly labelling him "The Interim One" in a clear reference to "The Special One" Jose Mourinho, whose name echoed around Stamford Bridge in the second half, with boos for the Spaniard following seconds later. The win will do nothing to transform Benitez's standing in the eyes of many Chelsea supporters but it was a win that keeps him on course for his target of ensuring they have a place in next season's Champions League. Oscar should have added to Ba's goal but was out of luck while West Brom only threatened late on as keeper Petr Cech saved from substitute Peter Odemwingie and turned away a deflection from his own defender Cesar Azpilicueta. Benitez arrived virtually unnoticed in his technical area before kick-off and while he was the target of some chants throughout the first half  - and jeers when he picked up the ball to speed up play - the atmosphere never rose to anything approaching serious hostility. The mood was helped by an impressive first 45 minutes from Chelsea as Benitez kept captain John Terry and striker Fernando Torres on the substitutes' bench. Oscar should have given Chelsea the lead in the third minute but his poor finish from only eight yards allowed West Brom keeper Ben Foster - watched by England manager Roy Hodgson after ending his self-imposed exile from international football - to save. West Brom barely registered as an attacking force until the last 10 minutes, although Cech was forced to turn Steven Reid's long-range free-kick over the top. Chelsea finally got the lead they deserved in the 28th minute. Foster had clawed away David Luiz's free-kick but, from the resulting corner, he was powerless to stop Ba scoring from close in after the Brazilian defender headed Oscar's cross into his path. The second half saw the Baggies enjoy more possession without a cutting edge, despite the introduction of Odemwingie in place of Marc-Antoine Fortune just after the hour. Oscar had worked plenty of shooting opportunities but he was once more thwarted by Foster with 13 minutes left when the keeper saved well from his low shot after Ba's header down. The youngster was undeterred and brought another fine save from Foster moments later. Odemwingie almost provided the equaliser manager Steve Clarke needed as West Brom finally caused some anxiety late on. Cech turned his free-kick over the top then showed quick reflexes to turn away a header from his own defender Azpilicueta. Given that encouragement, keeper Foster joined the attack for a stoppage-time corner but Chelsea came through and Benitez will hope some focus now returns to the football at this chaotic club.  West Brom boss Steve Clarke:  "Ben plays like that week in, week out. He's probably made Roy [Hodgson, England boss] happy because he's made himself available for selection and it gives Roy a nice problem. "The Peter Odemwingie saga for us is over. It's finished. He's a key member of our squad and he's got a big part to play for the rest of the season. "We stayed in the game until the last minute but couldn't quite get the clear-cut chance that would've got us a point."

24.04.2013 23:34:19 Everton breathed new life into their push for a European place with a comfortable win which increased Reading's relegation worries. Marouane Fellaini opened the scoring after connecting with Seamus Coleman's inviting cross before Steven Pienaar doubled the lead with a 20-yard finish. Pienaar then turned provider as the South African set up Kevin Mirallas. Reading, who remain in the relegation zone, scored a late consolation through substitute Hal Robson-Kanu's header. While David Moyes' side move to within two points of fifth-placed Arsenal, who play on Sunday, Reading's Premier League future remains in a precarious state. This was their third straight league defeat, a run they must address as four of their last 10 games are against Manchester United (away), Arsenal (away), Liverpool (home) and Manchester City (home). The only negative for Everton was the fifth-minute loss of Phil Jagielka to an ankle injury after a challenge by Adam Le Fondre which could sideline the England defender for several weeks. Reading arrived on Merseyside with the Premier League's worst away record and without injured first-choice goalkeeper Adam Federici. Yet for 42 minutes Brian McDermott's side frustrated a team that had been displaying all the signs of a side running out of steam at the business end of the season. Few Everton players have suffered a bigger dip in form than Nikica Jelavic and the Croatian striker was denied his first top-flight goal since 9 December when goalkeeper Stuart Taylor, starting his first Premier League match for five years, saved well with his body in a one-on-one situation. There was also a Premier League debut for Everton goalkeeper Jan Mucha, starting in place of the injured Tim Howard. And the Slovakian was left breathing a sigh of relief when Le Fondre hit the post from 15 yards after the Toffees defence had failed to deal with a 20th-minute corner. But Reading's early endeavour evaporated once Fellaini opened the scoring with his 11th league goal of the season, a well placed 42nd-minute header from six yards after good work by Coleman. Two goals in the space of six second-half minutes killed off any hopes of a Reading comeback. It was Pienaar who made it 2-0 in the 59th minute, beating Taylor with an excellent finish into the top corner from the edge of the area after a delightful run. Then the former Tottenham player turned provider - Pienaar's exquisite 66th-minute pass finding an unmarked Mirallas inside the Reading box and the Belgian made no mistake with his second goal in as many games. If there is one positive McDermott can take from his side's current predicament it is that they do not give up. Seven of Reading's previous 11 league goals before the game had arrived inside the last 10 minutes and they conjured up another late goal at Goodison Park. Sadly for the Royals, substitute Robson-Kanu's unmarked header from Ian Harte's 83rd-minute cross proved nothing more than a consolation. Indeed, Everton would have won by a more handsome scoreline had Harte not cleared Victor Anichebe's late attempt off the line.  Everton manager David Moyes:  "I thought we started well but the injury (to Jagielka) rocked us badly and it took us a wee while to settle after that. "Reading were always a threat, had a few chances, hit the bar. "That is the way the Premier League is, whoever you play, the games are tight."  Reading manager Brian McDermott:  "There was nothing in the first half but they have got major quality. "When Adam Le Fondre had a shot and hit the post - if that goes in maybe it's different. "It was a great goal they scored, the first goal; and the second goal, what can you say? "But we played some great football after that and that gives me real hope going forward."

24.04.2013 23:34:19 Shinji Kagawa scored a hat-trick as Manchester United beat Norwich at Old Trafford and extended their lead at the top of the Premier League to 15 points. United deservedly opened the scoring when Kagawa volleyed past Mark Bunn in first-half stoppage time. Norwich pressed for an equaliser but Kagawa ended their hopes with a neat finish before dinking a third. Wayne Rooney sealed the victory with a stunning effort as United warmed up for the visit of Real Madrid in style. Three days before their visit in the second leg of the Champions League last 16, the Spaniards will take note of the ruthless manner in which Norwich were killed off. In fact United were not at their best, but nor did they need to be, a low-key match wrapped up in comfortable fashion later on. With a healthy lead over Manchester City and that crucial European match looming, Ferguson made six changes, so the anticipated 1,000th senior appearance by Ryan Giggs - a day after signing the new contract that will take him into a 23rd season at the club and past 40 years of age - would have to wait for another day. But there was no shortage of attacking quality, Robin van Persie and Rooney lining up in attack as Antonio Valencia and Kagawa provided ammunition from wide. Norwich, the last team to beat United in the top flight, actually made the stronger start, Bradley Johnson failing to pick out an unmarked Grant Holt with a disappointing left-wing cross. However, United's central midfield pairing of Michael Carrick and Anderson swiftly began to dictate the tempo and it was not long before Ferguson's men found themselves camped in opposition territory. Bunn raced off his line to foil Van Persie after the Dutchman played a one-two with Rooney, but the goalkeeper should have done better as United took the lead moments before half-time. Just when it seemed Norwich had reached the break unscathed, Van Persie deflected Valencia's cross into Kagawa's path and the Japanese midfielder sent a low strike past Bunn at his near post. The visitors carried a far greater threat in the second period and Russell Martin - who did not appear to know Holt had been penalised for climbing on Patrice Evra in the build-up - shot over from close range when it seemed easier to score. Chris Hughton then introduced Kei Kamara, fresh from his goalscoring cameo against Everton, and the Sierra Leone striker was denied by some dogged defending from Jonny Evans. That proved a pivotal moment, however, as Carrick found Rooney with a long pass and the England striker teed up Kagawa to coolly wrong-foot Bunn and double the lead. The same man then raced through to chip his hat-trick and Rooney got in on the act with a stunning long-range fourth.  Norwich manager Chris Hughton:  "Conceding just before half-time hurt us but we were still very much in the game. "We conceded a poor second. You have to make decision - settle for that or give yourself an opportunity to get back into the game. When you try to get back into the game you open up and there's no better team than united to capitalise. "This was never going to define our season, but we're certainly disappointed.

24.04.2013 23:34:19 Jay Bothroyd scored a late winner to boost Queens Park Rangers' hopes of staying up and deal a blow to Southampton's own survival prospects. QPR took the lead against the run of play when Loic Remy finished clinically from Junior Hoilett's lofted pass. Southampton equalised through Gaston Ramirez, who followed up Julio Cesar's save and chipped the goalkeeper. But QPR snatched only their third win of the season as Bothroyd turned in a low cross from Park Ji-sung. In a tense finale, a late corner almost brought about an equaliser for Southampton, but Maya Yoshida's header was brilliantly saved one-handed by substitute goalkeeper Robert Green, who had only just replaced the injured Brazilian Cesar. Six minutes of injury-time followed before bottom club QPR were able to celebrate a crucial win which moved them to within four points of safety, and left the Saints just three points above the relegation zone. QPR boss Harry Redknapp punched the air in delight at the conclusion of a difficult afternoon in which he was booed throughout on his first return to Southampton since he sparked fury among the fans by leaving to rejoin arch-rivals Portsmouth seven months after relegation. The outcome also justified his decision to drop Adel Taarabt and field a new-look strike force, with the recalled Remy, Bothroyd and Hoilett all playing decisive roles. After being greeted by a chorus of boos as he emerged from the tunnel, the opening exchanges of the match did little to lighten Redknapp's mood as QPR struggled to cope with the home side's pace and movement. Adam Lallana and Jack Cork both went near from long range, while Jason Puncheon had an appeal for a penalty turned down by referee Howard Webb. But the momentum shifted as Hoilett and Remy combined to give QPR the lead from their first attack. Hoilett's pass caught the Saints' defence on the turn and Remy sprinted clear to beat Artur Boruc with a crisp finish, which the retreating Danny Fox narrowly failed to clear off the line. The goal seemed to energise QPR, who enjoyed a period of control, with Remy a constant threat on the right flank. A physical encounter claimed its first victim when Saints captain Lallana was forced to leave the field after a collision with Clint Hill, but his replacement Rodriguez provided the spark the home side needed. His low strike from the edge of the box was parried by Cesar straight into the path of Ramirez, who clipped a sublime finish over the QPR keeper. There was still time for QPR to fashion a chance before half-time as Bothroyd latched on to a loose ball inside the box, but could not find the target with his left-footed drive. Southampton went on the offensive after the restart with centre-back Jose Fonte firing wide before Rodriguez curled a delightful effort on to the roof of the net. The right wing remained QPR's most profitable avenue and it was from there that they carved out what proved to be the winning goal. Park slid in to dispossess left-back Yoshida and crossed from the byeline to Bothroyd, who tapped home his first Premier League goal of the season. With five minutes on the clock, Yoshida had a golden chance to make amends for his error, rising highest to meet James Ward-Prowse's header. But Green - brought on in the 73rd minute when Cesar limped off with a thigh injury - pulled off a superb save to keep QPR's slender hopes of beating the drop alive.  Southampton manager Mauricio Pochettino:  "We didn't expect this result but we have to accept it because we have made some mistakes. "We've tried very hard and put in a great effort to get a different result but because of errors and their keeper's intervention we didn't get a positive result." "I have confidence in my team, but we need to keep on working for this result and prepare the next game against Norwich."  QPR manager Harry Redknapp:  "It was a big result for us, this is a difficult place to come and Southampton are a good team. "I picked 11 players to work hard and when you work hard you get your rewards. I don't see Southampton getting sucked into a relegation battle. They are a good side."

24.04.2013 23:34:19 Jack Collison fired West Ham to their first Premier League away win since November to stun Stoke and lift them nine points clear of the drop zone. Substitute Collison latched on to a Ricardo Vaz Te pass before angling the winner past home keeper Asmir Begovic. Begovic kept out a Matt Jarvis strike, while Stoke went close through a long-range Peter Crouch effort. Charlie Adam almost equalised with a 22-yard shot which hit the crossbar for a labouring Stoke. An injury-time Gareth Bale goal had inflicted a painful defeat for the Hammers against Tottenham on Monday but, to their credit, they resolutely held on at the Britannia Stadium, albeit with the help of the woodwork. Stoke suffered only a second home defeat of the season and, despite manager Tony Pulis throwing on plenty of his attacking players in search of a goal, they were constantly repelled by the visitors. The victory moved West Ham level on points with Stoke who have now lost six out of their last eight league matches. The Hammers had been forced into some early readjustments, with midfielder Matt Taylor and playmaker Joe Cole having to go off injured in the first 11 minutes. Taylor was helped off in a daze after being caught flush in the face by Crouch's foot when the striker was attempting an overhead kick while Joe Cole's involvement was ended by a hamstring problem. Collison and Vaz Te replaced the stricken Hammers duo. West Ham showed the greater endeavour and energy, with defender James Collins going close when his glancing header from Gary O'Neil's cross grazed the top of the crossbar. Stoke have relied on their home form for all but nine of their 33 points this season but they posed little threat and might have conceded a penalty for Ryan Shotton's clumsy challenge on Mohamed Diame. West Ham won it when their two early substitutes combined. Vaz Te was the provider, playing in Collison after his initial pass came back to him off Stoke defender Ryan Shawcross, who had fallen to the ground as he tussled with Andy Carroll. The Potters showed more urgency after the break but their appeals for a penalty were correctly ignored by referee Jon Moss after Cameron Jerome went down under a challenge by Joey O'Brien with the West Ham defender appearing to get a toe to the ball. Hammers winger Matt Jarvis had a left-foot shot saved by Begovic and, at the other end, Crouch had a long-range effort kept out by visiting keeper Jussi Jaaskelainen. Vaz Te could have given West Ham some breathing space but he dallied too long when given a sight of goal from Collison's pass. Stoke again felt they should have had a penalty but Hammers defender Guy Demel survived a handball shout before Adam hit a powerful shot which crashed back off the crossbar. West Ham held out for a crucial win to give them some breathing space ahead of the trip to Chelsea in a fortnight while Stoke will wonder why their season has faded away since Christmas.  Stoke boss Tony Pulis: "We are disappointed with their goal because Andy Carroll drags Ryan Shawcross in the build up and I thought we should have got a free-kick. "I thought we huffed and puffed and didn't get enough quality into the box. People will criticise the forwards for not scoring goals but they need the service. "We have gone a bit flat. We missed Matthew Etherington and Robert Huth. We need them back, we need our best players."  West Ham manager Sam Allardyce: "We had to overcome the blow to losing Matt Taylor and Joe Cole early on. "It is a fantastic and we deserved victory for us. "When I saw Charlie Adam's shot - because of the number of wonder goals that have gone in against us - I thought not again but we got a bit of luck and the win."

24.04.2013 23:34:19 Sunderland rallied from two goals down to draw with Fulham and end a three-match losing run. Dimitar Berbatov scored a penalty to make it 1-0 after Craig Gardner felled Ashkan Dejagah and Sascha Riether added a second from a counter-attack. Gardner pulled one back from the spot after Philippe Senderos tugged Danny Graham's shirt. And Stephane Sessegnon equalised moments after Black Cats keeper Simon Mignolet denied Berbatov. The result takes Fulham into the top half, nine points above the drop zone, while Sunderland are now six points clear of the bottom three - and without a win in five games. Sunderland had not scored at home in a month and a half but they almost ended that streak within 60 seconds as John O'Shea headed Adam Johnson's corner into the side netting. Fulham had barely had a chance at goal before they won their penalty to open the scoring. Dejagah went down easily after a tackle by Gardner and Berbatov calmly and coolly just passed the ball into the corner, leaving Mignolet rooted to the spot. Dejagah has caught the eye this season for the Cottagers following his summer move from Wolfsburg and should have doubled their lead when he latched onto an enormous Mark Schwarzer kick down the field but flashed his shot wide of the goal. However the Londoners did find a second and Dejagah had a major hand in it. Berbatov headed clear a Sunderland corner, the Iran midfielder took the ball on and played it out to Bryan Ruiz, who in turn played the ball back to Dejagah. His shot was parried by Mignolet into Riether's path six yards from goal and the German, on loan from Cologne, tapped into an empty net for his first goal in English football. But within three minutes, Sunderland ended their home goal-scoring drought when Senderos tugged Graham's jersey in the box and Gardner blasted the penalty into the top-right corner. And having created little up to that stage, the goal seemed to spark them into life - the lively Sessegnon taking on three players with pace and skill and forcing a save from Schwarzer, before Gardner skewed a shot over from 25 yards. Graham was making his first start at the Stadium of Light following his Â£5m move from Swansea and early in the second half he should have pulled his side level when the ball broke to him 10 yards out but Schwarzer was able to easily keep out his shot. Sunderland midfielder Alfred N'Diaye was growing in stature as the game went on and blazed a shot high and wide before heading over Gardner's cross. However it was from the next chance that the game was decided. Bryan Ruiz's brilliant scooped ball landed to Berbatov in the box but he was denied by Mignolet's feet and Sessegnon led the counter-attack, which he finished from 18 yards out after Adam Johnson's ball broke to him in the box. Sunderland were in the ascendancy by this stage and looked the more likely to win but Fulham held on to go 10th in the table.  Sunderland boss Martin O'Neill:  "I thought we could have won the game. From 2-0 behind, it's a big point. But we put relentless pressure on once we got back to 2-2. "There was an incident towards the end when one of their players handled the ball and the referee has not given a penalty. I'm pretty disappointed. They have a difficult job but he was in the spot to give the early penalty against us. "I thought he was going to book their player for diving but he gave the penalty. "You can talk about luck and in the last few games, we shouldn't have lost any of them. I thought we deserved to win this. "Simon Mignolet's save was a big moment in the game, it could have gone 3-1. He has been fantastic for us this year."  Fulham boss Martin Jol:  "In hindsight we controlled the first half. Of course the penalty situation changed the course of the game. After that Sunderland smelt blood and had their confidence back. But I still feel it wasn't a penalty kick. If you give that, you have to give four or five in every game. "Don't forget, we should have made it 3-1 and put it to bed. We did ever so well in the first half, we controlled the game and dominated them. I'm not happy with one point. "We were the better team, it should have been a win. All these teams look behind them (in the table), everyone could be dragged into it."

24.04.2013 23:34:19 Substitute Luke Moore's first Premier League goal of the season gave Swansea a hard-earned win against Newcastle at the Liberty Stadium. The win takes Swansea to 40 points but they had to survive sustained pressure from the visiting side. Newcastle hit the crossbar and forced a series of saves from goalkeeper Michel Vorm in the second half. The result sees Alan Pardew's Magpies drop to 15th place, 10 points behind Michael Laudrup's Swans. Newcastle might feel aggrieved at the result, especially after a second half in which they looked the stronger side. In fact, before Moore's late intervention, it had taken a finger tip save by goalkeeper Michel Vorm from Yohan Cabaye's fierce shot to keep the home team level. Fellow Frenchman Moussa Sissoko also proved a handful for the Swansea defence, but Laudrup's team showed some steel to go with the style for which they are renowned. The Swans had the Capital One Cup on display by the side of the pitch for inspiration but made a shaky start even so, with Garry Monk almost caught out at the back for the hosts. But with Angel Rangel causing problems down the right-hand side, they soon had chances with Michu heading over from close range and then Steven Taylor having to clear Ashley Williams's close-range effort off the line. The defender should really have scored after Michu had touched the ball past goalkeeper Rob Elliott from Jonathan de Guzman's free-kick. Newcastle harried Swansea, their physical approach earning bookings for Cabaye and Cheick Tiote, the latter rather unluckily as he clearly did not make contact with with Nathan Dyer. Monk headed over from eight yards from another De Guzman free-kick as Swansea continued to have the better chances, but they could not find the breakthrough before the interval. The home team again almost took the lead in the opening minutes of the second half, but were denied by a fine double save from Rob Elliott, the Magpies keeper palming Rangel's shot away and managing to keep out De Guzman's follow-up as well. Newcastle enjoyed their best period in the second half, though first Papiss Cisse and then Yoan Gouffran failed to test Vorm. But the goalkeeper had to be on his mettle when he touched Cabaye's shot onto the crossbar. Vorm was suddenly the busiest player on the field, turning around a swerving long-range effort by Sissoko. But the breakthrough came at the other end, as Wayne Routledge's cross deflected off Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa into Moore's path, and his shot found its way into the corner via a deflection off Cabaye.  Swansea City manager Michael Laudrup:  "I think we were excellent in the first 45 minutes. I was a little concerned there would be a reaction after the cup win last week, [but] not at all. They were excellent for 45 minutes. "Second half they came out they put us under pressure, they had a couple of good chances or three. "Michel Vorm had a couple of very good saves, so at that point it looked as though they were going to maybe score the goal and win the game, and then we scored."  Newcastle manager Alan Pardew:  "We are frustrated and disappointed we did not even get a draw as we more than deserved that. "We sat off them for the first 20 minutes of the first half but we sorted that at half-time. In the second half I thought they had settled for a draw, they knew they were doing well to stay in it. "But when we did not score in that great period we had you know any mistake can be costly and that is what happened. "We missed two or three big chances and you cannot do that at this level. The goal was sloppy, it's a ball into the box, we had four defenders there and it should have been dealt with better, unfortunately it wasn't and it cost us."

24.04.2013 23:34:19 Gareth Bale continued his incredible scoring run with a stunning last-minute winner against West Ham to lift Tottenham to third in the table. Bale gave his side the lead with a powerful strike before Hammers forward Andy Carroll won and scored a penalty. On the 20th anniversary of Bobby Moore's death, Joe Cole put West Ham ahead with a low shot but Spurs drew level when Gylfi Sigurdsson poked home. Bale sealed the points from long range with his eighth goal in six games. It was another show-stopping performance from Tottenham's man of the moment after a string of superb saves from West Ham keeper Jussi Jaaskelainen looked certain to frustrate Spurs. Picking up the ball in a central area some distance from goal, he worked it on to his favoured left foot and arrowed a drive, which dipped over Jaaskelainen's outstretched right hand and into the top corner. The Welshman has now scored eight of his team's last 10 goals in all competitions and 19 in total this season. Almost single-handedly he has lifted Spurs two points clear of fourth-placed Chelsea going into Sunday's crucial north London derby against Arsenal, who are a further two points back in fifth. For the Hammers, Bale's strike was a devastating blow after a whole-hearted performance which did justice to the memory of England's World Cup-winning captain Moore. Cole's goal gave them a 2-1 lead and had substitute Matt Taylor not been thwarted by Spurs keeper Hugo Lloris when through on goal it could have been a different story. Before kick-off, the Upton Park crowd joined both sets of players in a minute's applause to pay tribute to Moore, who played more than 500 games for West Ham. Hammers players warmed up in Moore number six shirts, a giant poster of the former defender was unfurled in the corner of the stadium before his three grandchildren placed the match ball on the spot. Roared on by their impassioned fans, West Ham made the brighter start and Lloris had to make a sharp low save to keep out a shot from Matt Jarvis after neat interplay between Carroll and Cole. But where there is Bale there is danger and the winger picked up the ball in a central position 25 yards from goal, pushed it past James Collins and lashed a left-footed shot past Jaaskelainen to give Spurs the lead. West Ham drew level in the 25th minute after Scott Parker's lunging challenge took out Carroll's standing leg and referee Howard Webb pointed to the spot. The England striker rose to his feet and blasted the penalty into the roof of the net. Spurs looked more likely to take the lead and West Ham were indebted to Jaaskelainen, who pulled off sharp saves either side of half-time to keep out goalbound headers from centre-back Steven Caulker. Spurs manager Andre Villas-Boas introduced Sigurdsson and it almost paid instant dividends as the Icelander curled a shot on to the post from outside the area. The rebound presented Emmanuel Adebayor with a golden chance, but his tame header gave Jaaskelainen a relatively straightforward save. West Ham responded to the scare in devastating fashion by scoring from their next attack. Joey O'Brien's lofted pass from the left wing picked out Cole's run and the former England midfielder swivelled before firing off a left-footed effort which bobbled past Lloris and into the far corner. Tottenham's quest for an equaliser was once again thwarted by the inspired form of Jaaskelainen, who palmed away yet another Caulker header from a corner before deploying all his athleticism to tip a fine curling effort from Bale over the bar. Lloris pulled off a brilliant stop of his own as he raced off his line to deny Taylor and the miss proved costly to the Hammers as Spurs equalised. West Ham's defence failed to clear a Bale free-kick from the right and the ball dribbled through to Sigurdsson who poked home at the far post. A rampant Spurs continued to bombard the home side's goal only to be denied by a goalkeeper at the top of his game as Jaaskelainen tipped Sigurdsson's effort around the post and pushed aside a close-range header from Adebayor. But just when both sides appeared to have settled for a draw, up stepped Bale to steal the stage.  West Ham manager Sam Allardyce:  "We made a terrific go of it. It was at a crucial stage when Matt Taylor got through one on one and their keeper made good save, we want to be scoring that. "At 3-1 there is no way back for them. "But I thought the lads caused them a lot of problems."

24.04.2013 23:34:19 Superb second-half goals from Yaya Toure and Carlos Tevez helped Manchester City to a hard-fought win over Chelsea and reduced the gap to Manchester United at the top of the Premier League to 12 points. City were rewarded for a more attacking approach in the second period, after a first half in which they missed countless chances, Jack Rodwell and Sergio Aguero both going close to scoring for the hosts. They had almost paid for their wastefulness when Frank Lampard had a glorious opportunity to register his 200th Chelsea goal, but his penalty was saved by Joe Hart seven minutes after the break. Eleven minutes later City were finally in front when Yaya Toure kept his composure in the box to steer an angled shot into the bottom corner from 10 yards. Tevez made the game safe with a blistering shot from 20 yards five minutes from time. Lampard was replaced by Victor Moses after a quiet afternoon for the 34-year-old England midfielder that largely typified Chelsea's attacking performance, their play only becoming more expansive once they had fallen behind. They have now lost their last four games at the Etihad and trail second-placed City by seven points with 11 games to go. More importantly, they can now be overtaken by fourth-placed Tottenham, who face West Ham on Monday. The champions' hopes of retaining their Premier League title still look slim, but this was the perfect response to the loss at Southampton in their last league outing. Manager Roberto Mancini's name was sung throughout by the home supporters, and although there have been some signs the Italian is feeling the pressure of being so far behind Manchester United, the atmosphere was buoyant throughout a freezing afternoon. The City boss has said goals are the difference between his and Sir Alex Ferguson's side this season, and before this encounter he demanded that his side begin at a tempo that would bring them an early breakthrough. Yaya Toure seemed to have got the message, having a shot saved by Petr Cech within 42 seconds, and for much of the first period it was City who showed the greater attacking endeavour. Rodwell, making his first start since September, returned to bolster the midfield and could have had a hat-trick by half-time. But the best chance fell to Aguero, who attempted to round Cech when he was one on one, only to run the ball out of play. Cech also did superbly to stop Matija Nastasic's point-blank header. Chelsea offered little threat and failed to exploit gaps down City's wings. Demba Ba looked dangerous against Kolo Toure, but the visitors' midfield struggled to keep possession well enough to feed the Senegalese striker. The picture changed dramatically almost immediately after the break. Branislav Ivanovic picked out Ba, and the former Newcastle striker took a touch before being brought down by the onrushing Hart, who was not even booked for the foul when he might have been lucky to stay on the field. Reprieved by the referee, Hart then redeemed himself with his team-mates as he dived low to his right to save well from Lampard's strike. The impressive Rodwell immediately made way for another striker in Tevez and the game opened up as a result. Aguero was played through twice but could not take either chance, leaving Yaya Toure - so often the man for the big occasion - to finally make the breakthrough. Silva collected the ball close to the goal-line and played it back for Toure, who skipped round two challenges before curling the ball into the bottom corner. After that, Chelsea at last looked the more likely team to score as Rafael Benitez brought on Moses and Oscar, but Tevez settled matters with his first goal in nine league games.  Chelsea interim manager Rafael Benitez:  "When you lose, you have to be disappointed and this game was important for us because we could have been closer to Man City, but we cannot give up. "We have to fight for the top four because Arsenal, Tottenham and Everton are close behind. [On the penalty awarded for a foul by Joe Hart on Demba Ba] "I haven't seen the replay, but at least yellow card. You can argue he is going in this direction but it is still a clear chance. I think it was a turning point. We didn't do well in the first half but we went to half-time at 0-0. "We were talking about keeping the ball, doing better and showing more character. Then we had the penalty. It was a crucial moment in the game."

24.04.2013 23:34:19 Sunderland took another step towards securing Premier League survival as manager Paolo Di Canio marked his first match at the Stadium of Light with victory over Everton. Stephane Sessegnon scored the game's only goal just before half-time, stabbing a shot beyond Everton goalkeeper Tim Howard. The visitors pressed in the second half, with substitute Nikica Jelavic's header saved before Leighton Baines's late free-kick was blocked. But Sunderland held firm to secure a second successive win under Di Canio. The Italian, who last Sunday guided Sunderland to a first victory in 13 years at Newcastle, had said he would not be paraded in front of the home crowd prior to kick off, instead choosing to keep the focus on his team and the game. True to his word, his appearance from the tunnel was subdued, shaking hands with Everton boss David Moyes before taking his seat in the dugout. The home fans were clearly still on a high from last week's 3-0 derby win at Newcastle, with some commemorating that result by arriving at the Stadium of Light in T-shirts displaying a cartoon image of a celebrating Di Canio. Their mood was further heightened as Sunderland attacked Everton from the outset, fashioning a couple of good chances inside the first 15 minutes. Danny Graham's powerful effort from just inside the area forced a good save from Howard before Seb Larsson sent a free-kick whistling just over the crossbar. Everton, meanwhile, enjoyed plenty of forays into the Sunderland half and gained numerous corners but still rarely threatened. Their best moment of the half was Kevin Mirallas's mazy run towards the edge of the area, which ended with his shot being deflected wide. The pace of the game settled down as half time approached but a mistake by Baines allowed Sunderland to snatch the lead in added time. The full back carelessly passed the ball to Sunderland's Larsson, who then sent Sessegnon racing towards goal and the Beninese forward's low shot bobbled just under Howard's outstretched arm and into the net. Everton boss David Moyes, conscious of the fact that defeat would dent his side's Champions League hopes, brought on Jelavic at the start of the second half and the change had the desired effect as the game opened up considerably. Jelavic headed wide just after the hour before the Croatian striker flicked Marouane Fellaini's low shot straight at Mignolet. Sunderland had a lucky escape late on when Larsson inexplicably attempted an extravagant backpass which caught Mignolet unaware and the Belgian had to grab the ball  to prevent it from sailing into the net. Everton were subsequently awarded a free-kick eight yards from goal and Mignolet was booked, but Baines's low effort was blocked and eventually cleared. The visitors poured forward in the final few minutes but the afternoon belonged to Sunderland, who held on to record a victory that will go a long way to preserving their Premier League status.  Everton manager David Moyes:  "We won't get a top four position. Every game was becoming a must-win and that will be difficult now. "It was an important game for us and we could not take anything from it. "We did not play well. We had an awful lot of pressure in the second half but we maybe didn't have the quality to get the goal."

24.04.2013 23:34:19 Newcastle came from behind to win an open and absorbing game against relegation rivals Southampton. Morgan Schneiderlin lashed in a shot for the visitors before Moussa Sissoko equalised with a six-yard tap in. A stunning 25-yard Papiss Cisse strike gave the Magpies the lead only for Rickie Lambert to sidefoot in a near-post cross to once again level matters. Danny Fox's handball let Yohan Cabaye score from the spot before Jos Hooiveld's own goal sealed a home win. It was the first time Newcastle had won a league game this season after conceding the opening goal and the victory moved them six points clear of the drop zone. The performance also continued their upturn in form since they reinforced their squad with a number of signings in the January transfer window, with Alan Pardew's side claiming three wins from their last four top flight matches. Southampton provided a severe test for their opponents but were brought back down to earth after beating champions Manchester City in their last game and they are three points above the relegation zone. It was 'French Day' at St James' Park in honour of the club's heavy contingent of players signed from across the Channel but it was a Frenchman for Southampton who opened the scoring after just three minutes. Jack Cork's diagonal cross from the right was nodded down by Lambert and Schneiderlin turned and half-volleyed a shot past Magpies keeper Rob Elliot, whose Premier League debut started in inauspicious circumstances. Pardew was ruthlessly sacked by Southampton by the then-League One club in August 2010 and his team mirrored his desire to win the match as they pressed for an equaliser. Southampton defender Hooiveld twice survived handball shouts against him. Firstly, a Cisse pass came off team-mate Luke Shaw and hit Hooiveld's arm, while the ball also struck the centre-back's arm as he blocked a Steven Taylor shot. Both instances appeared to be more ball to hand than the other way around but indicated Newcastle were threatening a goal, which was deservedly provided by Sissoko. The dancing and darting Yoan Gouffran's shot was saved by keeper Artur Boruc but Sissoko was on hand to slot in the loose ball. The Magpies went ahead when Cisse, who might have initially been offside, produced a spectacular long range dipping strike on the half-volley after keeper Elliot had launched a long ball forward. Southampton regrouped and equalised shortly after the break when Lambert turned in a low Adam Lallana cross at the near post for his 100th goal for the South Coast club. Lambert nodded wide at the far post and Lallana put a left-foot shot a yard wide as the visitors took their turn to dominate. However, a Mathieu Debuchy cross struck the outstretched arm of Southampton left-back Fox and Cabaye confidently scored form the spot to restore Newcastle's lead. And, when Fox's clearance from Davide Santon's left-wing cross inexplicably struck Hooiveld on its way into the Saints goal, the own goal secured Newcastle's victory.  Newcastle manager Alan Pardew: "You look at the Premier League table and we have now put ourselves in a position to attack 10th, and that was the importance of the victory [against Southampton]. "It wasn't about anything else for me, and that's how I tried to get the players' mindset. "I said to them afterwards, we should attack the top 10 now, and we can with this team. "What a considerable difference to six weeks ago it has made, the players coming back from injury and the new players."  Southampton boss Mauricio Pochettino: "We are very sad about the result, especially taking into account how well we started. "But especially after we got the first goal, we couldn't really control the game as we should have. "We went in at the end of the first half losing the game and for their second goal, it is clear that there was a foul on [Nathaniel] Clyne, and then that was followed up by an offside. That is clear on the images. "It's not a complaint, but these are details that had an influence on the end-result of the match."

24.04.2013 23:34:19 Arsenal earned some respite after a turbulent week as two Santi Cazorla goals helped them beat relegation-threatened Aston Villa. Cazorla powered in a low shot to give the hosts a sixth-minute lead. Arsenal could not make the most of their possession and were punished when poor defending let Andreas Weimann drive in a 22-yard equaliser. But Nacho Monreal cut the ball across for Cazorla to sidefoot in a winner from 12 yards after 85 minutes. The victory moved Arsenal to within a point of fourth-placed rivals Tottenham and, even though it was not a convincing win, it will come as a huge relief after home defeats by Blackburn and Bayern Munich in the past seven days. Villa will be heartbroken after a game in which they defended so resolutely after letting in the opener and were rewarded for their counter-attacking efforts when Weimann scored. However, they could not hang on for a point as Arsenal applied some late pressure and the West Midlands side dropped into the bottom three on goal difference. Villa next play champions Manchester City before relegation rivals Reading and QPR, while the Gunners, who will hope to improve on a laboured performance, are scheduled to play fellow top-four contenders Spurs and Everton. Gunners midfielder Jack Wilshere had highlighted that his side have a tendency to be slow starters in matches and he made sure that was not the case this time around. The England international was central to his side's play, surging clear from the left side in the opening minutes and having a driven shot fended away by keeper Brad Guzan. Arsenal, though, did not have to wait long for the breakthrough as they took advantage of some hesitant and uncertain defending from a Villa side without injured centre-back Ron Vlaar. Wilshere slipped the ball to Cazorla and, after his first shot was blocked by Nathan Baker, the Spaniard was quickest to latch on to the rebound before firing past Guzan. The visitors responded with a tenacity to test the home side's resolve and give their hosts plenty of anxious moments. Gabriel Agbonlahor had a shot parried away by keeper Wojciech Szczesny before the Villa forward narrowly failed to get on the end of a low Charles N'Zogbia cross across the Gunners goal. A mistake from Monreal let the lively Weimann surge clear and the Austrian cut the ball back for N'Zogbia, whose first-time shot was well saved. Arsenal briefly quelled Villa's threat and went close to a second when some neat passing ended with Olivier Giroud's low angled left-foot shot being saved by Guzan just before half-time. Villa centre-back Ciaran Clark gave the home side a scare when he met an Ashley Westwood corner just after the break only to put his effort disappointingly over. Giroud horribly sliced a shot wide at the other end and Arsenal's failure to add to their lead kept the visitors in with a shout of stealing an equaliser, which Villa duly did. A Villa clearance was poorly headed by Gunners defender Carl Jenkinson on the halfway line and N'Zogbia nodded the ball to Weimann, who raced unchallenged at the home goal before scoring with a low strike. Wenger's frustrations on the touchline were all too clear but his mood improved when a forward foray from Monreal let Cazorla tuck in his 11th goal of the season and help Arsenal avoid three successive home defeats for the first time since 2002.  Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger: "What is most difficult is not the critics, it is that we lost the last two games. I am not here to lose games, I want win. What hurts me the most is that we lost to Blackburn at home and Bayern at home. "When people come to the Emirates Stadium, they are not to go away with wins. All the rest concerns me less. Of course [it has been difficult], but you do your job and focus on the next game and try to win it. "That is what we did. I am not 30 years in this job at the top level and going to be destroyed by people saying I don't know what I'm doing. I have been in this job a long time and what is important is that we have responsibilities and we have to stand up for them and get the team ready to go into the next game ready to fight."  Aston Villa boss Paul Lambert: "I don't need to rebuild the confidence after that. But I haven't for a number of weeks now. The confidence is there. "The team were excellent against Arsenal. I don't think we deserved to get beat. We looked a threat throughout the whole game. In the first half we should have scored. But the way the lads played, I couldn't fault them. "I thought they were excellent throughout. I felt we should have scored more than one goal. And I thought we should have been in front at half-time. I thought we were unlucky to be down. "But we came out in the second half and went again - and got the equaliser. The equaliser was a brilliant finish, from a fantastic counter-attack. "We certainly didn't deserve to lose the game."

24.04.2013 23:34:20 Grant Holt's injury-time strike earned Norwich a first Premier League win in 10 games as they scored twice in the final six minutes to stun Everton. Canaries substitute Kei Kamara's towering late header seemed to have rescued a point for the Canaries. But Holt grabbed an unlikely winner when he stabbed the ball in from close range four minutes into added time. Everton had deservedly led through Leon Osman's close-range header before their capitulation in a remarkable finale. The result is a huge blow to the Toffees and their hopes of securing a Champions League qualification place. But they seemed certain to keep the pressure on the top four and stay within two points of fifth-placed Arsenal as they dominated the early stages of the second period, retaining possession with ease and frustrating their hosts. There was certainly no sign of the late drama to come as Everton eased into a half-time lead. Osman grabbed the goal when he headed home a teasing Leighton Baines cross six minutes before the break after a fine move on the left flank which also involved Steven Pienaar and Marouane Fellaini. Nikica Jelavic had earlier been denied by Mark Bunn when the goalkeeper blocked well with his feet after a smart turn and piece of control in the six-yard box, and Bunn also kept out a deflected cross from fit-again right-back Seamus Coleman. And, although the visitors did not create many clear-cut chances, they always posed the greater threat. A Holt shot that was well saved by Tim Howard when the scores were level was as good as it got for Norwich before the interval. However Sierra Leone striker Kamara's introduction after 58 minutes proved the turning point and he inspired the home side's incredible late comeback. Kamara headed narrowly wide from an inviting right-wing centre and that rare chance seemed to lift the home crowd and bring much-needed belief. With the pressure mounting, Kamara headed Norwich level with his first Premier League goal when he powered home a Robert Snodgrass corner. And, much to Everton manager David Moyes' disgust, Holt reacted quickest to bundle home the winner from close range after the scheduled three minutes of added time has passed.  Norwich manager Chris Hughton: "Once you are 1-0 down and you get back to 1-1, you have to be honest and say you settle for that. But the lads wanted something different and showed great drive and determination to get the winner. "We are past the 30-point mark now, so for us and the team, that is a big confidence booster. "Kamara is a very good character, very down to earth and is really delighted at the prospect of being at Norwich and in the Premier League. "We will have to see how he develops, but this is not a particularly tough group to integrate into and he has fitted in very nicely."  Everton boss David Moyes: "We had controlled the game, but were wasteful in the second half when we had chances to get another goal, and we were always going to be put under pressure at the end. "I cannot understand why he plays three minutes and 20 seconds for the stoppage time, but he has got that discretion, although I disagree with it. "We passed it well enough and tried to do the right things, but we were not good enough in the final third - but one thing is for sure, we did not deserve to lose. "There is still chances for us to do it (get into the top four), but we are going to have to be very good to do it. However, we should have seen this one out, if we have any real ambitions, then we have to make sure we do not lose that game."

24.04.2013 23:34:20 Ryan Giggs scored on his 999th senior appearance for club and country to help lift Manchester United 15 points above Manchester City with victory over QPR. The Welshman sealed the win after Rafael's spectacular 20-yard strike had given the visitors a first-half lead. The young Brazilian also showed his worth in defence when he cleared Chris Samba's header off the line. QPR improved after the break but Giggs timed his run to tuck in with 10 minutes left and later hit the bar. A stinging shot from Loic Remy was saved by David De Gea and it had looked like United might have to endure a nervous finish before Giggs's intervention settled the contest. In the end, there was time for Danny Welbeck and Wayne Rooney to waste further chances, as United inflicted a defeat that leaves QPR rooted to the bottom of the Premier League, seven points from safety. Manchester City, who face third-placed Chelsea on Sunday, now face a huge task to catch United with 12 games remaining. The only minor worry for the league leaders was an injury to Robin van Persie as the striker set up Rafael for the opener. The Dutchman was replaced before half-time after suffering what looked like a hip injury as he fell down a cameraman's bunker behind the goal-line. The visitors had already threatened through Javier Hernandez's early header before Rafael struck, and QPR were scarcely helping themselves by continually giving the ball away. It was one such loss of possession that led to the opening goal. Adel Taraabt was dispossessed by Giggs, who fed Van Persie and when Julio Cesar palmed away the Netherlands international's cross, the ball fell to Rafael, who sent his shot into the top corner. Andros Townsend fought back for QPR, demonstrating some neat skill but unable to find a finishing touch. The hosts then came close to an equaliser when Rafael cleared centre-half Samba's header off the line. Rafael was turning in a performance to back up Sir Alex Ferguson's recent assessment of the 22-year-old as a maturing presence, and moments later the right-back raced to the other end and provided a floated cross for Van Persie, but the striker's measured volley was tipped away by Cesar. That was the last meaningful action for Van Persie, who was replaced by Welbeck. But the change did little to disrupt United's dominance - Nemanja Vidic should have done better from Giggs's cross but headed over from six yards out. Jose Bosingwa, making his first appearance since 8 December following a reported fall-out with QPR boss Harry Redknapp, had a busy afternoon at right-back as United probed down the left through the dangerous Ashley Young. QPR retained possession better after the break and had chances to equalise when De Gea stopped Remy's strike, before keeping out another Samba header. But just as the hosts were beginning to build some momentum, Giggs - whose 999 games include 64 for Wales and four for Great Britain in addition to his 931 for United - latched onto Nani's pass to score his 168th club goal and demonstrate yet again his enduring value to United.  Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson: "It was a great result for us. It's another game away so it's important, we are 15 points ahead at the moment. "It was one of these games where the pitch was lively, the ground was tight. There wasn't a great deal of football in the first half to be honest, it was a display from us which was more about determination, concentration and defending and we got through it."  QPR boss Harry Redknapp: "I thought we were bang in the game, then little right-back hits a 'worldie' - he won't hit another goal like that as long as he plays football. "He's hit one out of the clouds that's gone in the top corner. Up until then there wasn't a lot in it. "This leaves us bottom today, but we won't be bottom at the end of the season. I still feel we'll get out of it. You probably think I'm mad, but I don't think I am. Everybody else has written us off, but I haven't. I still feel we have a chance."

24.04.2013 23:34:20 Two goals by Arouna Kone lifted Wigan Athletic out of the bottom three and increased 10-man Reading's relegation fears at the Madejski Stadium. The Ivory Coast striker opened the scoring when Maynor Figueroa's header hit his chest and flew into the net. Kone made it 2-0 moments later with a sublime finish following Jean Beausejour's defence-splitting pass. Figueroa completed the scoring, before falling victim to a dreadful Pavel Pogrebnyak challenge, who was sent off. Pogrebnyak could have broken Figueroa's ankle and the Russian's dismissal added to manager Brian McDermott's problems. McDermott knows his side must improve quickly if they are to stay up, particularly as his team's remaining 11 games include trips to Everton, Manchester United and Arsenal. They also have to host Liverpool and Manchester City. Wigan arrived at the Madejski Stadium with a solitary win in their previous 13 league outings and 51 goals conceded in 26 top-flight outings. No other team had conceded more in the Premier League yet it was Reading's back line who played like novices. It would have been much worse for the Royals but for goalkeeper Adam Federici, the Australian diving full stretch to deny Franco Di Santo following a powerful early run by the Argentina striker. Reading were a shadow of the side that had recently overcame West Ham,  West Brom and Sunderland at home. Hope Akpan headed wastefully over from Jem Karacan's inviting cross, before a fine interception by Paul Scharner prevented Pogrebnyak from turning Jimmy Kebe's centre over the line. But that was as good as it got for McDermott's lacklustre side. Kone knew little about his first goal; Figueroa's header hitting the former Seville forward on the chest before flying into the net. Yet, if the 29-year-old's opener was scruffy, his second proved his quality. Jean Beausejour's delightful pass split the home defence and allowed Kone, who has recently returned from the Africa Cup of Nations, to clip the ball over the advancing keeper into the net. Wigan's loyal away following were ecstatic yet it got even better after the break. Figueroa had not scored a top-flight goal for almost two years but the Honduras left-back was celebrating after firing through Federici's legs following a clever one-two with Di Santo. Pogrebnyak was then shown a straight red card for an ugly challenge on Figueroa, leaving Reading to see out the remaining 36 minutes with 10 men. Having struggled all season, Wigan will be confident they can build on the momentum of this win to secure a ninth successive season in the Premier League.  Reading manager Brian McDermott:  "I'm going to move on quickly from that game. It's the only thing you can do in a situation like that. "The first 43 minutes there wasn't too much in the game. They got a real spring in their step once they scored. "But we didn't do the right things at the right time. We didn't get the details right."  Wigan manager Roberto Martinez:  "The first goal came from a set-piece but the two after are as good as you are going to see. "If we had done that previously in the season we would be in a much better position. "The quality of our attacking play was a real difference."

24.04.2013 23:34:20 Romelu Lukaku scored twice for West Brom as the Baggies beat Sunderland to keep their hopes of claiming a Europa League place alive. Lukaku's penalty, after a Craig Gardner handball, put the hosts ahead. The Belgium striker doubled his side's lead when Sunderland goalkeeper Simon Mignolet's clearance rebounded off him. Stephane Sessegnon curled home a late consolation, but Albion held on for a deserved win. All the talk pre-match was about West Brom's Peter Odemwingie, who had not played since trying to force a move to QPR on transfer deadline day, and he was booed as he came on as a late substitute. But it was the performance of the outstanding Lukaku that stole the show as the 19-year-old was at the heart of everything good Albion did. Lukaku's efforts, along with intelligent play from strike partner Shane Long, helped take the Baggies up to seventh as they aim to play in a major European competition for the first time in 31 years. Sunderland played their part in an exciting game and they should have stolen a point in injury-time when James McClean fired over. Baggies manager Steve Clarke had insisted reaching the 40-point mark was his side's first target, which they have now done with 11 games remaining. But it was Sunderland who should have taken the lead when Steven Fletcher's low shot hit the foot of the post before the Scotland striker wasted a second chance by shooting over the bar. The hosts deservedly went ahead in the 35th minute when Lukaku, making only his 12th Premier League start of the season, slotted home a penalty after Liam Ridgewell's cross had been handled in the area by Gardner. It was his 11th goal of the season, although that should have come a minute earlier when he had a goal harshly cancelled out. Referee Roger East pulled the ball back for a free-kick after Chris Brunt was fouled while sliding a clever pass through to Lukaku, who finished well past Mignolet. Lukaku, on loan from Chelsea, was unlucky not to score more goals, twice seeing powerful efforts parried by a busy Mignolet. But Albion were living dangerously by failing to double their lead and could have conceded when Sessegnon's weak prod at goal lacked power and was hacked off the line after goalkeeper Ben Foster had flapped at a cross. They did get their second when a horrible backpass from Titus Bramble was well short and Mignolet, having to run from his penalty area, cleared the ball off Lukaku and into his own net. Sessegnon curled a late goal back for Sunderland but it was not enough and the defeat, which means Sunderland have only won two of nine matches in 2013, leaves the Black Cats only five points clear of the relegation zone.  West Brom manager Steve Clarke: "I was a little bit nervous. We have to learn to manage the game a little better and see it out better than that. It didn't have to become a game of basketball, which it did in the last 15 minutes. "It's nice to get back-to-back wins and give the supporters a nice Saturday evening."  Sunderland manager Martin O'Neill: "Really disappointing to lose the game considering we had so many chances. That's the last three matches we've played where we shouldn't have been beaten. "The big decision was the penalty kick which was given against us. But then there was a similar situation at the other end where it wasn't given. I've seen both of them back. Both are penalties. "We played very well indeed and got nothing out of the game."

24.04.2013 23:34:20 Dimitar Berbatov's immaculate volley was enough to beat Stoke City and earn Fulham just their fourth victory in 19 Premier League games. Berbatov smashed the ball in from 10 yards to give them a deserved lead deep into first-half injury-time. Stoke wasted a glorious chance to level after the break when Mark Schwarzer saved a Jonathan Walters penalty. But Fulham continued to create the better chances and held on to move nine points clear of the relegation zone. Stoke were much improved after the interval but, following a lively start to the second half in which Peter Crouch went close and Walters saw his spot-kick brilliantly saved, the hosts were able to see out the win without too much fuss. Ultimately, it was a piece of Berbatov brilliance that was the difference between the sides but, until his strike, he had been at his most infuriating. The Bulgarian's languid style regularly leads to criticism that his effort does not match his artistry, and for 46 minutes the flicks and tricks failed to come off - his most notable contribution had been to inadvertently elbow Stephen Nzonzi in the face. But the goal, his ninth of the season on his 200th Premier League start, was worth the wait. Like nearly all of Fulham's best chances in a first half in which the hosts always looked the more likely to open the scoring, it was created on the right flank. Right-back Sascha Riether provided the crucial overlap and the telling cross and Berbatov carefully watched the ball drop onto on his right foot and crashed it past a helpless Asmir Begovic on the angle. Berbatov had earlier volleyed over from six yards after more good work on the right by Riether and Ashkan Dejagah and, in a rare foray forward on the left, John Arne Riise forced a comfortable save from Begovic. The visitors had been happy to sit and wait and play on a break - a tactic that brought their only previous away league victory of the season at West Brom.  A fine move involving Walters and Peter Crouch could easily have led to a far-post tap-in for Matthew Etherington but the cross was knocked away to safety by Schwarzer. Etherington was then taken off with a back injury and the visitors threatened only rarely until the start of the second half when they had their best two openings. The first came when Fulham defender Philippe Senderos made a complete mess of trying to allow the ball to run back to Schwarzer and the goalkeeper had to be alert to block Crouch's effort. And they had an even better chance to equalise when Dejagah blocked debutant Brek Shea's cross from the left with his arms but Walters saw his penalty kept out by a fine low diving stop from Schwarzer. After that it was Fulham who seemed the more likely to add to the tally. Berbatov went close with another measured volley and Riise almost curled in a delicious second for the home side with the outside of his left foot. But the hosts did not need the luxury of a second goal and moved up to 11th place in the table, one place and one point behind Stoke, whose abysmal away form continues.  Fulham manager Martin Jol: "Overall, if you saw the first half, we were the better team. It is always difficult against them and they changed their system and have all these big guys up front. "We should have scored a second goal but we didn't and in the end they could have punished us for the fact that we only scored one goal, but Mark Schwarzer saved the day for us."  Stoke manager Tony Pulis: "The first half was a very, very dead game and the only bit of quality was Berbatov's. Personally I think Fulham did not cause us many problems in the second half. We needed to score the penalty but we didn't. "If we score the penalty then it is a different game. We have been closer in away games this year and have had opportunities and chances that we haven't taken."

24.04.2013 23:34:20 Liverpool ended a five-match winless run in style with a dominant display over a weakened Swansea City. Steven Gerrard's penalty set Liverpool on their way when Kemy Agustien was ruled to have brought down Luis Suarez. Suarez then released Philippe Coutinho for his first Liverpool goal, before Jose Enrique finished a flowing move. Liverpool's superiority was rubbed in by Suarez's stylish solo score and a Daniel Sturridge penalty after Wayne Routledge handled in the area. Ex-Swansea manager Brendan Rodgers, who left south Wales for Merseyside in May, recalled Sturridge, cup-tied for Liverpool's midweek 2-0 Europa League defeat at Zenit St Petersburg, to his starting line-up. Daniel Agger and Lucas Leiva also returned, while midfielder Coutinho - an Â£8.5m signing from Inter Milan - made his Anfield debut. With one eye on next Sunday's Capital One Cup final against Bradford City, Michael Laudrup made seven changes from his side that humbled Queen's Park Rangers 4-1.  Top scorer Michu was left on the bench, along with regular starters Ashley Williams, Angel Rangel, Routledge and Nathan Dyer. That saw winger Roland Lamah make his first league start for the Welsh side, while Israel striker Itay Shechter was asked to lead the line. Suarez tested Michel Vorm, firing straight at the Swans goalkeeper, while Stewart Downing and Glen Johnson also missed chances as the Reds retained a firm grip on the game. Suarez was twice brought down on the edge of the area, but first Gerrard and then Suarez were unable to find the target with free-kicks. Sturridge wasted a golden chance, getting under his header six yards out after Downing had beaten Ben Davies down the Liverpool right. Coutinho then missed the chance to open his account in front of the Kop, picking up a loose ball after Sturridge had driven into the Swans area but putting the ball just wide. The breakthrough came after Agustien appeared to clip Suarez's ankle in the area, referee Howard Webb pointing to the penalty spot after assistant Mike Mullarkey flagged for the offence. Gerrard, who had missed a penalty in the home loss to West Bromwich Albion, held his nerve and just beat the plunging Vorm low to the keeper's right. That was the first goal Swansea had conceded to Liverpool in their three previous Premier League encounters, but a second, third and fourth followed in the opening 11 minutes of the second half. First Suarez released Coutinho and the Brazilian surged past two defenders before beating Vorm with a cool finish. Coutinho was then just wide with another attempt before Sturridge, Suarez and Enrique combined with a mesmerising move down the left. The ball was pinged between bemused Swansea defenders to set up Enrique, drifting inside, to power his shot into the roof of the net from close range. Swansea's early resolve and discipline had dissolved under the flurry of goals and Suarez was able to jink past Kyle Bartley and Garry Monk before picking his spot for Liverpool's fourth. Routledge had come off the bench for Swansea but unfortunately for the visitors the winger conceded a penalty for handball when he challenged Suarez for a lofted pass. Gerrard generously gave the spot-kick to Sturridge, but the result was the same as the former Chelsea man slammed the ball past Vorm. Liverpool were playing their third game in seven days, having lost 2-0 on Monday at home against West Brom before losing in Russia on Thursday in the first leg of their Europa League last 32 game with Zenit St Petersburg. But this match ended on a sour note for the hosts as striker Fabio Borini, who only came on as a 78th minute substitute, landed badly in a challenge and dislocated a shoulder, an injury that will rule him out for the rest of the season. The Italian, signed for Â£10.5m from Roma in July, left the field screaming in agony as the Reds ended the match with 10 men after already making their three substitutions. Liverpool's victory saw them climb above Swansea into seventh place but the Swans must regroup for their Wembley encounter with Bradford next Sunday as they bid to claim their first major trophy and a place in next season's Europa League.

24.04.2013 23:34:20 Gareth McAuley and Romelu Lukaku scored late goals as West Brom pinched a remarkable victory at Liverpool to end a sequence of six games without a win. The away side, managed by former Reds assistant boss Steve Clarke, weathered sustained pressure, including a superb penalty save from Ben Foster to deny Steven Gerrard after 77 minutes. That seemed to inspire Clarke's team, who went close from fit-again midfielder Youssouf Mulumbu before McAuley headed in Chris Brunt's corner nine minutes from the end. Worse was to come for the hosts on a frustrating and freezing night at Anfield as substitute Lukaku broke forward, glided past Daniel Agger and shot beyond Pepe Reina. The result not only ended the Baggies poor run but also lifted them a point above Liverpool into eighth in the Premier League table.  Defeat for Brendan Rodgers's team was their first in four games at Anfield and came when it looked like his side were beginning to build momentum after encouraging draws against Arsenal and Manchester City.  The result perhaps underlined the importance of injured striker Daniel Sturridge, who has scored four goals in six appearances since joining Liverpool in January. His absence meant Luis Suarez played in a lone striker role, and the Uruguayan at times was unable to burst into the box to finish moves that he had helped to create. Jonjo Shelvey, in the side instead of Sturridge, had the ball in the net but his effort was correctly ruled out for offside, while Gerrard and Stewart Downing tested the excellent Foster with long-range shots. But Liverpool came closest to scoring before the break via West Brom's Steven Reid, who almost put the ball into his own net under no pressure at all following Shelvey's cross. Rodgers's side upped the tempo after the interval as the home support grew increasingly frustrated and Liverpool were almost rewarded but Foster stopped Jordan Henderson's backheeled effort after a flowing move. At the hour mark, it appeared as if West Brom were happy to stick with what they had. They continued to get men behind the ball and were in no rush to get the game going again after various re-starts. They still had Foster to thank for a fine save to deny Fabio Borini, after the substitute collected Downing's cute lay-off, and then the Baggies goalkeeper produced a firm hand to stop Gerrard's powerful effort from inside the box.  The former England keeper left his best until last, though, when he dived to his left to claw away Gerrard's penalty after Jonas Olsson conceded the spot-kick when he crashed into Luis Suarez. The captain's effort was Liverpool's 19th attempt on goal. West Brom responded immediately with Reina tipping Mulumbu's long-range shot round the post - with what was the visiting team's first effort at goal. But McAuley leapt unmarked to nod in Chris Brunt's delivery from the subsequent corner. Lukaku, who in a bold move had been brought on in place of midfielder Graham Dorrans after 74 minutes, sealed the stunning victory with his stoppage time strike, dealing a further blow to Liverpool's slim hopes of qualifying for next season's Champions League.

24.04.2013 23:34:20 Manchester United extended their lead at the top of the Premier League to 12 points with a routine victory over Everton at Old Trafford. Sir Alex Ferguson's side took full advantage of champions Manchester City slipping up at Southampton on Saturday evening to open up a commanding gap as they go in search of their 20th title. United made few concessions to Wednesday's last-16 Champions League meeting with Real Madrid in The Bernabeu as a strong starting line-up closed out another crucial win with few alarms. Real coach Jose Mourinho watched from Old Trafford's directors' box as Ryan Giggs scored for the 23rd successive top-flight season to give United an early lead and Robin van Persie added his 23rd goal of the season just before half-time. Everton never looked likely to repeat last season's feat of clawing back a two-goal deficit to draw 4-4 at Old Trafford. That was a comeback that fatally damaged United's title chances but this time they never seriously threatened such a shock. Manager David Moyes suffered a setback just before kick-off when experienced defender Sylvain Distin pulled out with a virus after feeling unwell in the warm-up, forcing the Scot to draft in John Heitinga after he struggled so badly in the 3-3 draw against Aston Villa.  United should have taken an early lead when the pair combined to open up Everton's readjusted rearguard. Wayne Rooney played in Van Persie, who rounded Everton keeper Tim Howard but proved his fallibility by striking the outside of an upright from the angle. Everton did not survive a second time shortly after when Van Persie escaped the ponderous Heitinga in the area to set up Giggs, who scored from 12 yards via the inside of a post. There was some hope for Everton as they enjoyed a spell of possession and Leon Osman brought a fine diving save from David De Gea with a 20-yard volley - but United struck crucially just before the interval to put the game out of reach. Everton had played a dangerous game as Van Persie was caught narrowly offside on a number of occasions but there was no flag to rescue the Merseysiders as he raced on to Rafael's pass, evaded Howard once more and scored despite Heitinga's best efforts on the line. The second half meandered tamely until the 65th minute when United's Jonny Evans was blocked three times in a goalmouth scramble, twice by Howard, who then saved spectacularly from Tom Cleverley. It had been a relatively subdued affair but there was a burst of action as Van Persie screwed an effort wide at one end then Everton substitute Nikica Jelavic's low shot brought De Gea into the action. Old Trafford was emptying long before referee Mark Halsey's final whistle and this increasingly looks like the weekend when United took an unassailable lead over their title rivals.  Everton manager David Moyes:  "It is only our fourth league defeat this season and I would say it is the only game where a better team has beaten us. We have got Leon Osman and Steven Pienaar, who we really rely on - and people like Leighton Baines - and we are asking a really big shift of these players because we can't change the team around too much. "People talk about Everton starting slowly and having a good half a season not a full one and maybe that's because we are asking a small number of players to do that for a full season. But these lads have done brilliantly and we are still in a really good position. "If you had given me two draws against Manchester United and two points I would have said that that was good but we have taken three points off them so that's even better although we are obviously disappointed we lost today. "I think 12 points to make up [for Manchester City] against a club like Manchester United is a big gap. Football doesn't always go the way it is meant to but that does look like a big gap. It is difficult to predict what will happen in football but it is a big thing to be that amount of points behind at this time of the season."

24.04.2013 23:34:20 Southampton extended their unbeaten run to six games with a hard-earned point at Swansea. Rickie Lambert came closest to breaking the deadlock in the first half when his free-kick forced Michel Vorm to make a fingertip save. Swansea found it hard to break down a stubborn defence and Nathan Dyer had a shot cleared off the line by Maya Yoshida. Vorm preserved a point for Swansea when he denied substitute Emmanuel Mayuka. Southampton are eight points clear of the Premier League's relegation zone but Swansea have now gone five games without victory. Swans boss Michael Laudrup had described the match as a must-win game in their bid to finish in the top 10 with only three points separating the sides at the start of play. Laudrup's side started brightly and Angel Rangel's volley into the box missed the outstretched boot of Luke Moore, before Jonathan de Guzman's shot was blocked by Jos Hooiveld. Luke Moore narrowly failed to get on the end of a Dyer's cross but the Saints were slowly growing into the game. Jack Cork's effort from 25 yards forced Vorm into making the first save of the game and Jay Rodriguez tried his luck with a speculative effort which went over the crossbar. Rodriguez, who replaced Gaston Ramirez in the starting line-up, fired a low shot from the edge of the box which Vorm had to stretch to save. Southampton continued to press and were awarded a free-kick following Chico Flores' foul on Adam Lallana on the edge of the penalty area. Lambert curled in a dangerous kick which was heading into the top corner before Vorm pulled off a spectacular save to tip the ball over the crossbar. From the resulting corner Vorm failed to hold onto the ball and Lallana netted - but the Southampton captain was adjudged to have fouled the keeper and the goal was disallowed. A Swansea change at the interval saw Wayne Routledge replacing Luke Moore and the substitute created the first chance of the second half. Routledge got behind the Southampton defence and crossed from the right but top-scorer Michu headed over Artur Boruc's crossbar. Michu flashed a header wide before the Spaniard capitalised on an error by Lallana to set up Dyer, but the winger's effort was cleared off the line by Maya Yoshida. Swansea kept probing but found themselves up against a resilient Southampton defence and Boruc denied De Guzman and Dyer. Substitute Mayuka came close to snatching all three points for Southampton with a minute remaining but Vorm saved his his close-range effort with his leg.  Swansea manager Michael Laudrup:  "We did so well on occasions until the last pass. "The last pass is so important and it is an area we could have done better in. "I think we should have won but when you don't you have to accept a draw and look on the positive side. We had conceded two goals in each of our last four games and we have now kept a clean sheet."  Southampton manager Mauricio Pochettino:  "It was not a very good game but we are unbeaten in six games and I am happy with the clean sheet. "Maybe we should have won because we created the best chances but their goalkeeper made two outstanding saves. "I don't know if 39 points will be enough for us to stay in the Premier League, we just have to go on and try and win the next game, that is always our goal."

24.04.2013 23:34:20 Aston Villa's hopes of Premier League survival received a major boost as two quick-fire goals saw off West Ham and moved them out of the bottom three. After a poor first half, the hosts went ahead through Christian Benteke's penalty after Mark Noble clumsily fouled Charles N'Zogbia. N'Zogbia doubled the lead moments later, curling in a 20-yard free-kick. Ashley Westwood's late own goal set up a tense finale, but the hosts held on to the relief of the Villa Park crowd. However, Paul Lambert's men needed two injury-time saves from goalkeeper Brad Guzan, denying Kevin Nolan and Carlton Cole, before they could celebrate their first Premier League win since the 3-1 victory at Liverpool on 15 December.  With bottom six rivals Queens Park Rangers, Wigan, Reading and Newcastle all losing on Saturday, Villa knew they would climb up to 17th place with a first success in nine league games. But they had to survive a nervy final few minutes as West Ham piled on the pressure against a team that surrendered a two-goal advantage at Everton last weekend. Villa boss Lambert had sprung a surprise in his line-up as, with striker Gabriel Agbonlahor absent through illness, he handed a first Premier League start to 21-year-old Jordan Bowery, a Â£500,000 summer signing from League Two Chesterfield.  It meant Â£18m club record signing Darren Bent, who had only played 79 minutes of Premier League football since November, was again left on the bench. Villa, who had only scored twice in their previous seven home Premier League games, would have been in front inside two minutes but for an horrendous miss by Andreas Weimann. Benteke cut in from the left wing and saw a powerful shot parried by Hammers goalkeeper Jussi Jaaskelainen. The ball fell to the unmarked Weimann six yards out but the Austrian, who made his first start for his national side in the week, pushed his effort beyond the far post. For a long time, it looked as though Weimann's miss could prove costly as West Ham upped the tempo in the second-half and posed a greater attacking threat. Ciaran Clark and Ron Vlaar blocked goal-bound chances, before Lambert replaced the ineffective Bowery with Bent, who was immediately involved in the action. It was not, however, in the manner expected as the Villa striker cleared Andy Carroll's attempt off the goal-line with his first touch of the match. The hosts finally took hold of an ugly game when N'Zogbia was adjudged to have been fouled in the area by Noble. Benteke kept his composure to send Jaaskelainen the wrong way with the spot-kick for his 15th goal of the season, and the home fans had barely stopped celebrating before Villa doubled their lead, N'Zogbia curling a wonderful free-kick into the top corner. Villa, who also threw away a two-goal lead against West Brom last month, faced an anxious final five minutes after Joe Cole's cross looped off Westwood's head and over a backpedalling Guzan. West Ham almost snatched a point at the death but Guzan made two crucial saves from Nolan and Cole as Villa held on for the victory.  West Ham manager Sam Allardyce:  "Apart from the Aston Villa fans, anyone who watched this afternoon knows we deserved something. "The sad thing is, after not converting our chances, we have paid the price by conceding from a free-kick and a penalty. "Apart from Jussi Jaaskelainen spilling an early shot which fell to Weimann, Aston Villa created and contributed nothing. "We were waiting to see what Villa had to throw at us in the first half and we coped with that. Then our plan was to go at them in the second half and we created chance after chance. "We completely dominated the second half and we've ended up losing 2-1. Even at the end their goalkeeper was the hero."

24.04.2013 23:34:20 Manchester City's title defence suffered a huge blow on the south coast as they gifted Southampton victory with a series of glaring errors at the back. Gareth Barry gave the ball away for Saints' first goal, with Jason Puncheon following up to slot home after Jay Rodriguez's shot was saved. Steven Davis made it 2-0 after Joe Hart made a hash of Rickie Lambert's shot. Edin Dzeko replied on the break but City's misery was complete when Barry inexplicably passed into his own net. It was a disastrous defeat for Roberto Mancini's men, which means leaders Manchester United can extend their lead at the top of the Premier League to 12 points with 12 games to go if they beat Everton at Old Trafford on Sunday. Saints, meanwhile, move six points clear of the relegation zone. They thoroughly deserved their first win under new boss Mauricio Pochettino but this is a game that will be remembered for City's defensive horror show, coupled with careless passing and lethargic attacks, which leaves their hopes of retaining their crown in tatters. City had arrived at St Mary's with the best defensive record in the top flight but, in the absence of captain Vincent Kompany and his regular partner Matija Nastasic, they showed precious little authority in their back-four. Javi Garcia, usually a defensive midfielder but being used at centre-back, was particularly uncertain with his positioning, and Saints punished him ruthlessly when they took the lead after seven minutes. Puncheon stole the ball off Barry and, when Garcia joined Joleon Lescott in closing him down, played in Rodriguez in space on the edge of the area. Hart saved his effort but Puncheon had continued his run and rolled the rebound into an unguarded net. Southampton's industry and discipline did not allow City any opportunities to respond and things got worse for the visitors when the usually dependable Hart made a shocking error, dropping Lambert's shot and letting it squirm between his legs for Davis to turn it over the line. Saints' tactics were simple - press high up the pitch and attack with pace when they forced mistakes. It almost brought them a third goal, when Rodriguez volleyed narrowly wide, before City finally found some rhythm before half-time. They replied with a classic counter-attack, started by Dzeko when he headed a corner clear on the edge of his own area, and finished by the Bosnian too after he slid in to scoop home Pablo Zabaleta's cross. That gave City hope of staging another comeback similar to the one they mounted at the Etihad on the opening weekend of the season when they trailed Saints 2-1 but won 3-2. In truth, they never came close to a repeat. Saints could have had a penalty before the break when Yaya Toure appeared to barge Rodriguez over in the box, but referee Martin Atkinson awarded a corner instead. That decision did not make a difference in the end as the final blow was administered by their own hand or, to be precise, Barry's left foot. There was no danger and no-one near Barry when Lambert's cross reached him in the middle of City's area but his attempt to play the ball back to Hart resulted in him placing the ball into the bottom corner of his own net instead. Mancini threw on James Milner, then Aleksandar Kolarov and Maicon to try to find a way back into the game, but to no avail. His side were short of ideas and energy, and were out-passed and out-played. The closest City got to pulling another goal back saw Sergio Aguero denied by Artur Boruc's instinctive save, and the game ended with Saints looking more likely to extend their lead than surrender it.

24.04.2013 23:34:20 Frank Lampard provided another reminder of his enduring value to Chelsea by inspiring the victory over Wigan that ends a four-match winless run and eases the pressure on manager Rafael Benitez. The midfielder scored Chelsea's crucial third to move within four goals of Bobby Tambling's club record of 202. Goals from Ramires and Eden Hazard had put Chelsea 2-0 up, only for Shaun Maloney to pull a goal back for Wigan. Lampard fired in Chelsea's third goal before Marko Marin headed in late on. This was not a vintage Chelsea display but the result sees them leapfrog Spurs to reclaim third in the league table. The two late goals put a gloss on the scoreline but in truth it was harsh on Wigan. For long periods, especially in the second half, Roberto Martinez's side threatened to make it another nervy afternoon at Stamford Bridge. Lampard's intervention ensured it was anything but. The 34-year-old's fierce low shot for Chelsea's third goal capped a fine week and once again ensured the subject of his future at Chelsea was the talking point of the day. Lampard is now four goals from levelling Bobby Tambling's club record of 202. For Wigan, the picture was altogether more bleak. Martinez will take the positives but now faces having to repeat last year's great escape to avoid relegation. Stamford Bridge was once again subdued on a cold, damp day in London but having won just once at home since Aston Villa were beaten 8-0 before Christmas, this was both a welcome and overdue victory. With Juan Mata nursing a cold, Benitez unleashed David Luiz in midfield and the Brazilian captain thrived in the heat of the battle. It was the Brazilian who swept Chelsea forward on their way to the opening goal, slipping beyond Roger Espinoza and finding Torres. The Spaniard's first time pass ran into the path of a rampaging Ramires and his shot flew high beyond Wigan goalkeeper Ali Al-Habsi and into the net. Maloney was the heartbeat of the Wigan side. His clever runs, tireless chasing and quick feet made him a constant thorn in Chelsea's side. Petr Cech denied him with a diving save early on, before his wicked cross was diverted behind by Cesar Azpilicueta with James McCarthy waiting to head in at the back post. Franco Di Santo twice went close for Wigan but when Hazard thumped Azpilicueta's low cross beyond Al-Habsi to double Chelsea's lead 10 minutes into the second half, the game looked as good as over. History was stacked against Wigan, their only win at Stamford Bridge having come in the 1980 FA Cup. Wigan clung to the hope that Chelsea might continue their recent habit of throwing away leads. Within a minute of falling 2-0 behind, Wigan hit back. Hazard was caught in possession and Wigan broke with pace, Maloney beat the offside trap, rounded a charging Cech and steered the ball in from a narrow angle. With the home support sensing another nervy afternoon, Wigan pushed again. The visitors appealed for a penalty when Ronnie Stam's shot thumped into Ashley Cole's arm in the penalty area only for referee Mike Dean to wave them away. With Wigan pushing for an equaliser, Chelsea then killed the game. Hazard's cut back was dangerous and substitute Mata's clever dummy allowed the ball to run to Lampard 16 yards out. His unerring low shot flew into the corner of the net. With time ticking down and Wigan a beaten side, Marin was on hand to head in as Al-Habsi could only parry the impressive Azpilicueta's fizzing shot. It was a bitter pill for Wigan to swallow but Chelsea march on.  Chelsea manager Rafael Benitez: "We said before, for us we have to win every game. It was a a good game, an open game and to score four goals is always positive. "We had 27 attempts, which is quite good, and we had a lot of them inside the box. The team was attacking and creating and it was very positive. We deserved to win. Yes, we're making some mistakes, but we have a lot of positives. Today four goals could be six goals at the end."  Wigan boss Roberto Martinez: "I had to stretch the game, open up and leave ourselves exposed and on the counter-attack Chelsea took advantage of that. We were long enough in Chelsea's defensive third, and we had that presence there. I did feel that, if we'd got the equaliser, the ending would have been very interesting." On the penalty claim: "Clearly the ball is travelling to the corner, to a place that will be very difficult for the goalkeeper. And it is blocked by Ashley Cole's hand. How much the defender knows about that, how much you can avoid having the arm in that position, I don't know. But that was a key moment in the game."

24.04.2013 23:34:20 Norwich and Fulham played out a dismal draw at Carrow Road as the Canaries' winless run extended to nine games. City's new signing Luciano Becchio had a good chance for a debut goal after just five minutes but fired straight at Cottagers' keeper Mark Schwarzer. It turned out to be one of the only clear-cut opportunities in a game between two sides struggling for form. Steve Sidwell's 20-yard drive was Fulham's best effort, but they can take heart from a first clean sheet in 12. When Fulham thumped the Canaries 5-0 on the opening day of the season, few would have predicted they would be neck-and-neck in the table come February. But the two sides are both on 29 points after a result that edges them ever so slightly closer to Premier League safety. Both teams extend the gap from the relegation places to eight points, although Norwich boss Chris Hughton may have greater cause for concern. After going 10 games unbeaten before Christmas, they are now on a winless streak almost as long. Their predicament has been caused mainly by a lack of firepower, having scored just once in their last six matches. Argentine striker Becchio was signed in January to improve the Canaries' goalscoring form, and an early chance fell his way, but his shot from 10 yards was easily dealt with by Schwarzer. As it transpired, the former Leeds man wouldn't have a better opportunity all afternoon. The only other notable strike of a dire first half was a high kick from Bradley Johnson that hit Dimitar Berbatov in the forehead, forcing him temporarily off the field for stitches. The elegant Bulgarian seemed more offended by some of the efforts of his own team-mates, whose sloppy passing - especially from defence - curtailed most attacking forays before they had caused any damage. Fulham began with greater purpose after the break, Sidwell forcing their first shot on target with a powerful strike that was parried by Mark Bunn. But Norwich weathered the small storm and the match soon looked every bit a contest between two out-of-form teams, at times resembling a war of attrition. Elliott Bennett and Robert Snodgrass huffed and puffed trying to create something for the hosts, but with Becchio comfortably marshalled by Fulham's experienced centre-backs, clear openings were rare. Norwich finished the stronger, with Elliott Bennett having a shot blocked and Johnson scuffing a chance wide, but the final 0-0 scoreline was a fair reflection of the game.  Norwich manager Chris Hughton: "Fulham have a lot of quality in their side, but we are disappointed because we are at home and the emphasis was to look to get three points. "We did not have enough in the final third and lacked that bit of quality, but it is a point and if you cannot win these games, you certainly have to make sure you do not lose them. "The (lack of goals) is a concern, and it has to be, but we also have to look at the positives. "We have managed to stop a poor run, albeit not with wins."  Fulham boss Martin Jol on Dimitar Berbatov having to go off for treatment after being hit by Bradley Johnson's high boot: "I get very irritated by that, when someone kicks you and you have to go off for five minutes. "Later, Hugo Rodallega  was also kicked and he had to go off, and they played again with 11 against 10. "We have got to change that because it is an awful rule. You should send their player away as well for five minutes and play 10 against 10."

24.04.2013 23:34:20 Robert Huth and Cameron Jerome struck second-half goals to give Stoke their first win in 2013 and end Reading's resurgence at the Britannia Stadium. Adrian Mariappa scored but Reading were unable to find another late recovery as Stoke hung on to leave the Royals just above the relegation zone. Huth headed in off the underside of the crossbar, before substitute Jerome smashed in a second on the turn. Royals supersub Adam Le Fondre then saw a late penalty appeal turned down. Brian McDermott's side had taken points from their last four Premier League games with late goals but Premier League player of the month Le Fondre's only impact saw him go down in the box under a challenge from Ryan Shotton in injury time. Referee Michael Oliver waved the protests away and Stoke claimed a fully-deserved three points. The Potters dominated possession with winger Matthew Etherington picking out Peter Crouch with a couple of early crosses. But the striker's radar was way out as he failed to get a header on target. Stoke cranked up the pressure just before the break, forcing five corners in the space of two minutes as Reading were desperately hanging on for the half-time whistle. Adam Federici tipped away Ryan Shawcross's flick and was at full stretch to keep out Crouch's far post volley. When the Australian keeper was finally beaten by Huth's low shot from the edge of the box, Stephen Kelly scrambled his effort just wide. But Reading's resistance of the aerial bombardment was finally breached midway through the second half. Glenn Whelan's inswinging corner was met by Huth, who rose above three Reading defenders at the far post, to crash in a header off the woodwork. The goal lifted the tension around the stadium just as it was looking like Stoke, who went into the game with just one win in 10 Premier League games, could be denied again. And the second arrived 14 minutes later when Mariappa failed to deal with Huth's long ball. The defender's mistimed header dropped for Jerome, who used his strength to hold off Alex Pearce, before turning and driving in a fierce strike giving Federici no chance. Mariappa soon scored from a corner at the other end but Le Fondre could not summon up another late goal as the Royals lost in the league for the first time since New Year's Day.  Stoke manager Tony Pulis:  "We're pleased because I think we deserved to win the game. I've not seen the penalty (claim) but if we had not taken the points I'd have been disappointed because I thought we deserved it. "We should have come in at half-time winning the game. We got stronger and stronger as the game went on. "The disappointing thing is we've conceded from a set -lay because I don't think Asmir Begovic has had anything to do until he's picking the ball out of the back of the net."  Reading manager Brian McDermott:  "Most people would say it was a stonewall penalty. It's a very unfortunate that (the referee) has decided not to give that. In my opinion it's a penalty but he's had one look at it and not given it. "I thought we would get at least a point but they don't lose many games here."

24.04.2013 23:34:20 Santi Cazorla hit Arsenal's 50th league goal of the season to earn Arsene Wenger's 10 men a victory that lifted them to fifth spot in the table. The Spanish forward fired through a sea of Sunderland legs after good work by Theo Walcott, before Carl Jenkinson was sent off for two bookable offences. Arsenal were forced to endure some nervous moments, Steven Fletcher and Titus Bramble both wasting chances. Walcott hit the post for Arsenal, who lost Jack Wilshere to injury. Wenger will hope England international Wilshere, who limped off early in the second half, makes a speedy recovery. The Gunners struggled after the 21-year-old left the field before confirming a third win in four league games. Wenger's side were forced to dig deep to secure the points with Wojciech Szczesny producing a flurry of late saves to keep out Fletcher, Stephane Sessegnon and Adam Johnson. The tone for a hard-fought encounter was set inside the opening 10 minutes. The Black Cats welcomed back captain Lee Cattermole from a knee injury for his first league start since November and the midfielder was cautioned inside two minutes for a late challenge on Aaron Ramsey, before Jenkinson saw yellow for a lunge on Jack Colback. Jenkinson was only starting because French defender Laurent Koscielny tweaked his calf in the warm-up, Bacary Sagna moving to the centre of defence. Sagna endured a couple of nervous moments before the Gunners seized control through Cazorla's 35th-minute goal, a well executed finish from 15 yards through a sea of legs following a delightful move involving Walcott. Wenger's side were playing with confidence and authority. When the teams met in north London on the opening weekend of the season, the Gunners had 23 shots without scoring and they suffered further frustration as Simon Mignolet single-handedly kept the Black Cats in the game in the first half. The Belgian goalkeeper had already produced a flying save to keep out Ramsey's curling 20-yard attempt before Cazorla's goal. Then Mignolet spread himself to prevent the Wales international from making it 2-0 at the end of the first half. If the loss of Wilshere in the 50th minute was a setback for the visitors, then the red card flashed by referee Anthony Taylor in the direction of Jenkinson, who celebrated his 21st birthday on Friday, was a blow. The former Charlton player could hardly complain, however, after a clumsy challenge on Sessegnon brought his second yellow card. Suddenly it was all Sunderland. Fletcher blazed a chance wide after Sessegnon had dispossessed Ramsey and Szczesny then denied the former Wolves striker. Bramble somehow failed to score from close range in front of a gaping net, while at the other end Walcott hit the post with a low finish following a wonderfully weighted pass by the impressive Cazorla. There was still time for Adam Johnson to force another save from Szczesny but Sunderland, for all their determination and effort, could find no way through.  Sunderland manager Martin O'Neill:  "It was a great game from start to finish. The tempo was very high early on and it remained so. "Obviously Arsenal, a top-quality team, caused us a lot of problems in the first half but I also thought we looked dangerous as well. "But in the second half, we just came roaring at them, and that was even before the man had been sent off. "Seriously, looking back at a couple of the chances, I just don't know how we didn't score."  Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger:  "It was tight in the end, but it was a game with a high level of intensity where we have shown some brilliance going forward, but unfortunately we couldn't score the second goal. "Then we had to show another side in the second half, especially in the last 20 minutes, down to 10 men, we needed to be resilient, committed and deal with everything they offered us. "But overall, I think it was a typical Premier League game with top quality on both sides."

24.04.2013 23:34:20 QPR remain four points adrift at the foot of the Premier League as their five-match unbeaten run came to an abrupt end at the Liberty Stadium. They were 2-0 down inside 18 minutes, Michu following up Nathan Dyer's shot and Angel Rangel stroking home after Julio Cesar parried his first effort. Rangers substitute Bobby Zamora replied from a keeper's fumble after the break. But Pablo Hernandez weaved through to score from an acute angle and Michu hit Swansea's fourth with a deft finish. Although they made some expensive additions during the transfer window, with one goal in four league matches Harry Redknapp's team could ill afford an early two-goal deficit. Loic Remy was again absent through injury and Adel Taarabt was employed as a solitary striker but it was defensive frailties that caused immediate concerns for Rangers. Swansea dispelled any suggestion they might be distracted by their League Cup final against Bradford on 24 February by being quicker to the loose ball and far more inventive with their passing. An unmarked Wayne Routledge played a first-time lay-off to Nathan Dyer, given too much room in the centre of the field, and his shot from distance swerved in front of Cesar who could only push it out. Michu was the first to react, his right-footed volley from an awkward height looping into the net. Routledge, impressing against his former club, threaded a delightful ball through for Rangel to cut in from the right flank, and after his drive was blocked, the Spaniard coolly converted the rebound with his left foot. In the early stages the mercurial Taarabt produced an instant touch and flick so sublime it drew applause from both sets of fans but he could not significantly influence the match and demonstrated his frustration by blasting the ball away and tangling with several Swansea players. Redknapp was also simmering on the touchline and made a double change at the break, which brought immediate success when Taarabt's run and shot from the right was palmed by Michel Vorm into the path of Zamora on the penalty spot and he tapped in clinically. But two minutes later the visitors found themselves two behind again as Cesar, so impressive in keeping four clean sheets in his past five league games, was beaten by Pablo from close to the byeline following a jinking run and more delightful build-up play. Rangers pressed again in an absorbingly open encounter and were denied a penalty when a cross from Andros Townsend appeared to strike the arm of Ashley Williams, Kyle Bartley clearing the resulting shot from Stephane Mbia off the line. Michu, who also scored twice when Swansea beat Rangers 5-0 on the opening day of the season, was then able to hold off the powerful Christopher Samba following an exquisite through ball from Pablo to curl into the corner with his cultured left foot for his 15th league goal of the season. The Spaniard, troubled in recent weeks by a tight hamstring, was taken off as a precautionary measure with the Wembley showpiece to look forward to, while for QPR, who hit the bar late on through a Shaun Wright-Phillips volley, the visit of Manchester United in a fortnight is rather less inviting.  Swansea manager Michael Laudrup:  "I was relieved when we scored the third goal but overall it was a great performance. "We need it right now to get even closer to those 40 points that we want, we're very close now. "It was really important for me because we know next Sunday Liverpool away at Anfield will be very difficult. [QPR penalty claims] "From the bench it seemed like a handball and when I came in it still seemed like a handball but a couple of times I have been on the other side of decisions."  QPR boss Harry Redknapp:  "We conceded sloppy goals, I love the way Swansea play but I didn't think they had to work that hard for their goals, they should have been dealt with. "We looked better in the second half, we got back to 2-1 and I was thinking we'd get something from the game then suddenly we go and give two more goals away. "If Bobby Zamora was fit for 90 minutes we'd be a different team but he's had a hip injury and he can't play for 90 minutes, he seizes up at half-time. He's what a Premier League player should be, he holds the ball up, brings people into play and he's a target. When he doesn't play we don't have that. "He needs another operation but that would keep him out for 6-8 months and that's not an option."

24.04.2013 23:34:20 Gareth Bale continued his extraordinary scoring run to hand Champions League-chasing Tottenham victory at the expense of Newcastle. Bale gave Spurs a great start when he fizzed in a free-kick from 25 yards which beat goalkeeper Tim Krul. Yoan Gouffran equalised midway through the half when his firm shot went in off a slight deflection. But Bale made it four goals in three league matches when he ran onto Kyle Walker's ball before slotting in. In fact, he is the only player to have scored for the north London side in those games, underlining his importance and value, both to the team and in monetary terms. The 23-year-old international - who also scored for Wales against Austria on Wednesday - could have added three more to his tally late in the second half, only to be twice denied by the excellent reflexes of Tim Krul, before showing he is fallible by missing from three yards. But his manager Andre Villas-Boas and his adoring fans inside a packed White Hart Lane would have forgiven him for that blip. He remains among the league's top scorers with 13 - impressive for a midfielder. It must have felt like Groundhog Day for Newcastle when Bale scored inside the first five minutes, having conceded at Spurs during the same period last season.  The home side went on to hit Newcastle three more times in that opening 45 minutes, winning 5-0 in the end, but the Magpies are slightly more resolute outfit these days thanks to wise spending in January. Nevertheless, visiting defender Fabricio Coloccini fouled Clint Dempsey 25 yards from goal on the right. Bale took charge and poked his effort with plenty of dip over the wall, into the bottom right. Spurs were playing with Dempsey as the lone man in attack, with Bale, Aaron Lennon and new signing Lewis Holtby, making his first start, in support roles. Germany international Holtby had great stamina and played with a willingness to cover the whole pitch. But it is as an attacker for which he was purchased by Villas-Boas, and twice he had a chance to score from the fringes of the area with shot that just flew over the wrong side of the bar. Moments later, another new signing kept his shot low enough to bring the Magpies back into the match. Gouffran, signed from Bordeaux, was the man to level when Moussa Sissoko pulled the ball back for the forward to smash in via a deflection off the back of Michael Dawson. The goal settled Newcastle down, with Tottenham not given the sort of space afforded to them in the first quarter of the match. However, Alan Pardew's side were dealt a blow early after the restart when goalscorer Gouffran was carried off after receiving a nasty gash to his shin. It seemed to unsettle the visitors as Tottenham attempted to grab a foothold in the match; Bale again leading the charge. And it was the flying winger who ultimately decided the outcome when he latched onto a hopeful lofted ball from Walker and outpaced Stephen Taylor, before firing his shot past Newcastle's Dutch keeper. The Magpies came close to snatching a point when substitute Shola Ameobi's strike was deflected wide, but that would have been cruel on Bale and Tottenham, who look a good bet to take a Champions League spot.  Tottenham manager Andre-Villas Boas:  "It was a good win for the team. Newcastle were on a good run of form, so it was always going to be a hard game. "We stepped it up in the second half and showed team spirit to get three points. "Both sides had chances. We showed more determination in the second half and took control."  Newcastle manager Alan Pardew:  "Last year we were well beaten, but today we almost nicked an equaliser. Gouffran getting injured was a disappointment, as was the result. "On this occasion, Bale was the difference. All the big moments came through him. He's in a rich vein of form. "It was a good game of football. We tried to play and Sissoko produced another great performance."

24.04.2013 23:34:20 Manchester City now stand nine points behind Premier League leaders Manchester United after they were held to a draw by Liverpool at the Etihad Stadium. Edin Dzeko gave Manchester City an early lead but a contested strike from Daniel Sturridge against his former club drew Liverpool level before the interval. City appealed for a foul on Dzeko then waited for Liverpool to put the ball out of play with the striker lying injured. Liverpool, as they were perfectly entitled to do since no whistle came, played on and Sturridge's finish carried too much power for Joe Hart. Steven Gerrard added to his catalogue of long-range strikes to give Liverpool a lead they deserved with 17 minutes left but Sergio Aguero's audacious strike from the tightest of angles as he battled with keeper Pepe Reina gave City a point. Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini could have no complaints about the result as Liverpool showed the greater endeavour and energy for long periods, and his side now face an increasingly difficult task to claw back United's lead and retain their title. City recovered a similar deficit to win the title last season but they are currently missing a vital spark which they must recover quickly to have any chance of closing that gap. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers will feel encouraged by his team's display but will once again be left cursing their inability to protect a lead, a failing that also cost them at Arsenal in midweek. Sturridge was the game's outstanding performer and shows signs of fulfilling all of his rich promise, but the other reality for Liverpool is that, as the calendar moves into February, they have yet to record a Premier League win against any team in the top half of the table. Rodgers had been impressed with Liverpool's performance at Arsenal despite surrendering a two-goal lead and made only one change, replacing youngster Andre Wisdom with Jose Enrique. The hosts, missing injured captain Vincent Kompany and both Kolo and Yaya Toure who are away at the Africa Cup of Nations, were almost ahead inside the first minute as Reina had to react well to turn over David Silva's effort. They took the lead after 23 minutes when Dzeko applied a simple finish to James Milner's low left-wing cross. But the visitors were level six minutes later in circumstances Manchester City clearly considered unsporting. They first appealed for a foul as Daniel Agger clashed with Dzeko then waited for Liverpool to put the ball out of play as the striker lay on the turf. They were frustrated on both counts - the more so when Sturridge took advantage of Javi Garcia's poor clearance to flash a 25-yard shot low past Hart. The Etihad expressed its displeasure but Liverpool were perfectly entitled to continue as referee Anthony Taylor chose not to stop play. It was also telling that Dzeko made a swift recovery once the goal had been scored. Liverpool ended the half on top as a breakdown in communication between Hart and Pablo Zabaleta ended with the defender sending an attempted backpass past the keeper and only inches wide. City were struggling for any rhythm or momentum and it was no surprise when Liverpool took the lead with 17 minutes left. They did so in spectacular style, Gerrard picking up the ball 25 yards out and, as he has done so often in his wonderful career, drilling a low, unstoppable shot into the bottom corner. If Gerrard's strike was a thing of beauty, Aguero matched it five minutes later. The Argentine won a race for possession with Reina outside the area before defying all logic to find the net from what looked an impossible position. Both sides almost grabbed the winning goal in the closing minutes, substitute Maicon heading just over for City and Hart clawing away another 20-yard effort from Sturridge.

24.04.2013 23:34:20 Gareth Bale's stunning strike ensured Tottenham moved to within a point of third-placed Chelsea with a patient victory over 10-man West Brom. A drab first period in which Bale went close and Shane Long missed two decent chances for the hosts sparked into life two minutes after the break when Goran Popov was sent off for spitting. Spurs took full advantage of the extra man and began to dominate possession. Bale put them ahead with a 20-yard shot and they held on to win with ease. The Baggies barely threatened in the closing stages and the blame lay at the feet of Popov for his bizarre reaction to a mundane challenge from Kyle Walker. Until Popov's red card for spitting at the England defender West Brom had created the better chances, but their hopes of avoiding a fifth defeat in their last six games all but ended with his departure. West Brom, without wantaway striker Peter Odemwingie, had two good early chances and the imposing figure of Romelu Lukaku was at the heart of both. First the on-loan Chelsea striker easily won a high ball to send strike partner Shane Long through on goal only for the Republic of Ireland international to hopelessly over-run the pass. Lukaku, whose combination of brute strength and speed seemed to unnerve the visitors' defence, then got a decent shot on target from the left. But their best opening saw Long's low strike well blocked by the on-rushing Hugo Lloris in the Spurs goal after an exquisite outside-of-the-foot pass from Graham Dorrans. Unsurprisingly, Spurs' main threat in a flat first half came from the pace and direct running of Bale and Aaron Lennon. A fine burst from Lennon on the left teed up a great opportunity for Clint Dempsey at the far post but the striker headed wide from six yards. But it was Bale, operating centrally, who looked the most likely source of an away goal. Twice the Welshman glided down the right and delivered dangerous balls into the box and he was closest to opening the scoring when his delightful 20-yard left-foot curler forced a fine fingertip save from Ben Foster deep into first half-injury time. However Tottenham's lack of a Lukaku-type focal point and their inability to get numbers into the box meant the Baggies looked relatively comfortable. The away side's menace diminished further when Jermain Defoe limped off before the break with what appeared to be a badly twisted left ankle. That was a huge blow to manager Andre Villas-Boas, already deprived of the services of Emmanuel Adebayor who is on on Africa Cup of Nations duty. Defoe's replacement Lewis Holtby looked busy and tidy but, having failed to sign a striker in the transfer window, the last thing Villas-Boas needed was an injury up front. The game turned in Tottenham's favour, however, a minute after the break when Popov's moment of madness. Referee Mark Clattenburg immediately waved the red card at the defender and Spurs coasted to victory against their demoralised hosts. Lukaku was taken off as the Baggies reorganised and Spurs took full advantage of the extra man and began to completely dominate possession. Holtby's fizzing near-post shot forced Foster into action and Bale nearly got in on goal but was thwarted by a clattering but fair Foster challenge. But they were rewarded for their patience on 66 minutes. Spurs retained possession on the right and the ball was worked to Bale who skipped away from James Morrison and unleashed a fine 18-yard strike that beat Foster for pace and stretched his side's unbeaten Premier League run to nine games.

24.04.2013 23:34:20 Newcastle's lingering relegation fears continued after they were held to a draw by West Brom at The Hawthorns. Yoan Gouffran's glanced header from Papiss Cisse's cross put the Magpies in front, while the visitors wasted a number of chances to extend their lead. Baggies striker Romelu Lukaku's header hit the crossbar before Billy Jones slid in a left-foot shot to equalise. Newcastle hung on for a draw and are six points above 18th-placed Wigan, having played an extra game. Aston Villa, who are a place below Newcastle in 17th, play their game in hand against Manchester United at Old Trafford on Monday. Newcastle have only won once away in the league this season and should have made more of their first-half dominance before surviving several scares after the break. West Brom were worthy of the draw but manager Steve Clarke will be unhappy at a lacklustre first-half display. The Baggies knew they would have to be wary of a backlash from a Newcastle side beaten by derby rivals Sunderland last Sunday but Clarke's side went behind after eight minutes. Yohan Cabaye slipped a pass to striker Papiss Cisse and he sent a ball in for Gouffran to glance past keeper Ben Foster, who was caught halfway between his goal-line and coming for the cross. Midfielder Cabaye's vision and industry was key to his side's play and the French international twice went close with well-struck long-range strikes as one dipped just high and the other was saved. Newcastle centre-back Steven Taylor was also played in on goal by a delicate Gouffran pass, only for Foster to quickly come out and smother the close-range effort. West Brom's troubles were not helped when centre-back Jonas Olsson's back pass put Cisse in on goal, although the Swedish international's blushes were saved when the Magpies forward chipped over the bar. The home side rarely threatened but might have had a penalty on the stroke of half-time. Referee Mike Jones awarded a free-kick for a James Perch challenge on Billy Jones, even though the offence took place just inside the area. Mike Jones made the decision after consulting his assistant, with Newcastle's players arguing that Perch made contact with the ball before the Baggies right-back. The hosts were a different side after the break and a Lukaku header from Chris Brunt's corner came back off the crossbar before Newcastle eventually buckled. Lukaku had his back to goal as he gathered a James Morrison pass, before Billy Jones pinched the ball off his toes and slid a left-foot shot past Elliot to become West Brom's first English goalscorer this season. A Morrison header was tipped over the bar by Elliot before Newcastle's defence held firm for a point.  Newcastle manager Alan Pardew:  "We have to keep working and make sure we secure our place in this division because we will be a threat next year when we get everybody back. "I'm very pleased [with the point] because this is a tough place to come. We wouldn't let them play in the first half and should have, perhaps, had two goals before half-time. We had the energy that we didn't last week [in the defeat by Sunderland] and it was a massive difference for us. "Technically we might have been better but I couldn't fault our commitment and desire."  West Brom boss Steve Clarke:  "I was a bit concerned we had only played two games in 34 days and I think that showed at the start. "Newcastle picked up the game much quicker than we did. In the first half they were better than us. "On another day they could have got a second goal and it would have made it more difficult for us, but they didn't and it gave us the avenue back into the game, which I think we grabbed with both hands. Second half we were much, much better."

24.04.2013 23:34:21 Wayne Rooney's late winner at Fulham helped Manchester United extend their Premier League lead to 10 points. Rooney surged forward after 78 minutes to meet a Jonny Evans long ball and send a cool finish into the far corner for his 10th goal in as many games. The striker had earlier hit the post in an open match in which both teams threatened, with Fulham's Bryan Ruiz also denied by the woodwork. Ruiz also had a header cleared off the line before Rooney's goal. In a frantic finale, Fulham were denied an equaliser when United striker Robin van Persie cleared a Philippe Senderos header off the line. And with the home side exposed as they pushed for a leveller, Javier Hernandez then broke clear and only some smart goalkeeping from Mark Schwarzer denied the United forward. The visitors survived the remainder of stoppage time to secure a victory that puts extra pressure on second-placed Manchester City, who play Liverpool on Sunday. A match interrupted by a floodlight failure just before half-time looked like being a frustrating one for United but, as so often this season, the quality of their forward line came to their rescue. Fulham were beaten 5-0 in the corresponding fixture last season and 4-1 in the FA Cup by the Red Devils last week but they were a different proposition this time around. The Cottagers created the first opening when Hugo Rodallega broke clear and pulled the ball back for Ashkan Dejagah, who mistimed his shot. The chance sparked an open spell as both teams adopted the approach that attack was the best form of defence, the woodwork intervening on four occasions in the first half. Fulham somehow survived a goalmouth scramble that began when Schwarzer pulled off a reaction save after Van Persie's corner came off defender Brede Hangeland. Patrice Evra latched on to the loose ball, only for his shot to hit the bar before Rooney's follow-up was cleared off the line by Sascha Riether. If the visitors could not believe they were not in front, they were soon relieved not to be behind as Fulham twice went close in quick succession. First, a long-range John Arne Riise strike was tipped over by United keeper David de Gea before a counter-attack from the home side culminated in a Ruiz shot from the edge of the area that came back off the post. Hangeland, proving more of a hindrance than a help to the home side, then again went close to scoring an own goal when he inadvertently headed a corner against his own bar. Just when it seemed the game might calm down, United midfielder Tom Cleverley laid the ball off for Rooney, whose shot came back off the post. The players were forced off the field briefly when the floodlights failed before returning to play out the remainder of the first half in less frantic fashion than hitherto. Hangeland, who had picked up a knock, was replaced by Aaron Hughes at the start of a second half that saw Van Persie tamely head into the arms of Schwarzer when well-placed. As Fulham stood firm, United's frustration was reflected in the gestures from manager Sir Alex Ferguson in the visitors' dug-out. And the Scot's mood was not helped when centre-back Rio Ferdinand was caught in possession and Giorgos Karagounis dragged a 20-yard shot wide. The sides traded chances as they chased a win. Nani had a shot deflected high for the visitors, while Ruiz failed to get enough power on an effort for the hosts after Riether's effort had been parried by De Gea. With time running out, Rafael Da Silva cleared a Ruiz header off the United goal-line and it proved crucial as a clearance over the top from Evans released Rooney, who guided an expert strike around Hughes and past Schwarzer for the winner.  Fulham manager Martin Jol:  "We did well in midfield and at the back. It was one of our better performances this season. "But they are capable of creating something out of nothing, as Rooney did. Now, I think they will win it [the Premier League title]." He added: "We did well to get the lights on again. Normally it takes a long time. I feared when we came back our concentration was down and we would end up conceding a goal but it wasn't a problem."

24.04.2013 23:34:21 Substitute Lukas Podolski's deflected free-kick earned Arsenal victory and left battling Stoke City deflated at Emirates Stadium. Potters goalkeeper Asmir Begovic produced a series of fine saves before Podolski struck in the closing stages. Begovic denied Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain from five-yards, kept out Laurent Koscielny's header, then saved Oxlade-Chamberlain's angled drive. But Podolski's set-piece went in off Geoff Cameron to take the points. It was tough on Stoke, who looked set to end a run of seven straight league defeats away to the Gunners before Podolski pounced 12 minutes from time. The visitors claimed Olivier Giroud was in an offside position when the German's free-kick deceived Begovic after cannoning off Cameron. Referee Chris Foy consulted with his assistant before allowing the goal. Stoke were clearly agitated by the decision, with the game threatening to boil over in the closing stages. Potters substitute Michael Owen appeared to thump Mikel Arteta on his back after the Spaniard had challenged the former England striker. Arsenal, who included new Â£10m left-back Nacho Monreal, had scored 22 goals in the previous eight league games. But their form has been erratic of late, with three wins, three draws and two defeats since the turn of the year. And for long spells Gunners boss Arsene Wenger seemed frustrated as he prowled the touchline. His side carved out a string of chances but found Begovic, 25, in inspirational form. Stoke's decision to pay Â£3.5m for goalkeeper Jack Butland earlier in the week produced an impressive response from the first-choice Bosnian. Having denied Oxlade-Chamberlain from inside the six-yard area after Stoke had failed to deal with a corner, the former Portsmouth goalkeeper kept out Koscielny's powerful header. Yet his best save came four minutes before the interval. A delightful pass from Jack Wilshere presented Oxlade-Chamberlain with another opportunity but the Gunners were left frustrated. Stoke created little going forward but their stubborn rearguard display looked like earning Tony Pulis's side a precious point. That was until Andy Wilkinson's lunge on Theo Walcott, which earned the Stoke player a booking, and allowed Podolski to score from the free-kick.  Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger:  "I said already before the West Ham and Liverpool games, that we are in a position where we cannot drop points. "We dropped two points against Liverpool but we couldn't do it again. What is more important is the quality of performances is there. The spirit is there. "The target is to be in the top four and to focus on the two cups we are still in."  Stoke City manager Tony Pulis:  "We've leaked a lot of goals in the last couple of games and although we've played Manchester City twice, Chelsea and now Arsenal, it has been a difficult run. "But that was the same at the beginning of the season and we only have Manchester United and Tottenham at our place now. "We've got most of the big ones out of the way."

24.04.2013 23:34:21 Marouane Fellaini produced a towering second-half display, scoring twice as Everton came from 3-1 down to deny Aston Villa their first league win of 2013 in a breathless encounter at Goodison Park. The Belgian headed in an injury-time equaliser to leave Paul Lambert's young side staring at each other in disbelief, having come within minutes of inflicting what would have been only Everton's second home defeat of the season. The result leaves Villa in the bottom three. For 93 minutes it had looked as if this would be Villa's day. Christian Benteke fired them in front early on, only for Victor Anichebe to bring Everton level. But two headers, the first from Gabriel Agbonlahor, and a brave second from Benteke, set Villa on course for victory. But with 20 minutes remaining Fellaini fired a low shot beyond goalkeeper Brad Guzan. With the final whistle near, the Belgian leapt to head in Leighton Baines' corner and deny Villa three vital points January had been a chastening month for Lambert's side. Elimination from the Capital One Cup and FA Cup by Bradford City and Millwall respectively, plus defeats by fellow strugglers Newcastle and Southampton left them in the bottom three. Their last league victory came in their most-recent visit to Merseyside - against Liverpool on 15 December. For 90-plus minutes it had looked as if lightning would strike twice. On both sides, the football was muscular and committed but devoid of finesse. The challenges were fierce, with neither side able to string more than a handful of passes together on a dry and bobbly pitch. Villa snapped into the challenges from the off and landed the first blow in the second minute. Charles N'Zogbia drifted in from the right, with Benteke gathering his neat pass and surging beyond a static John Heitinga before drilling a low shot across Everton goalkeeper Tim Howard into the far corner of the goal. It woke Everton from their slumber and Fellaini came within a whisker a minute later. But Everton had to wait another 15 minutes to get back on terms, Anichebe holding off Ciaran Clark and steering the ball beyond Guzan. Within two minutes, Everton were behind again, their defence switching off and allowing Agbonlahor to rise unchallenged and head in Ashley Westwood's right-wing cross. Agbonlahor's pace meant the visitors were a constant threat and the England international created another wonderful chance. His through-ball set Andreas Weimann racing towards goal but, with just Howard to beat, the Austrian forward blazed over. It was to prove a warning shot, as Villa struck again to go 3-1 ahead. Matthew Lowton found space on the right and his pin-point cross was met by Benteke's brave diving header that steered the ball beyond Howard. But Everton were in no mood to roll over as Fellaini's low strike flashed beyond Guzan after a neat exchange of passes with Anichebe. Villa must have thought they had won until Everton were given a 93rd-minute corner, from which Baines picked out Fellaini who rose majestically to have the final word.

24.04.2013 23:34:21 Moussa Sissoko scored twice on his home debut as Newcastle came from behind to beat Chelsea in a rousing game. Former Magpies striker Demba Ba had the first decent chance, but headed wide and then went off as he was caught in the face by Fabricio Coloccini's boot. Minutes later, Jonas Gutierrez headed the opener but Chelsea responded through Frank Lampard's thunderbolt and Juan Mata's curling finish. Sissoko equalised on 68 minutes and struck the winner in stoppage time. It was a thrilling introduction to the home supporters for the French midfielder, who signed for Newcastle on 25 January and was a constant threat. Newcastle boss Alan Pardew described his new capture as the difference in their crucial win over Aston Villa in midweek, and here the 23-year-old proved indefatigable by teaming up superbly with fellow home debutant Yoan Gouffran and the scheming Yohan Cabaye to eventually eclipse their visitors. Consecutive victories for the first time since April moved Newcastle eight points clear of the relegation zone and suggested that, despite losing Ba to the European champions earlier in January, they have realistic hopes of climbing the table again. Chelsea, for all their second-half revival, fell to their first away defeat since 1 December. Indeed, Rafael Benitez's side are now winless in four games in all competitions, and although there were some enterprising moments, not least Lampard's and Mata's superb goals, this result will hardly win Benitez any new fans at Stamford Bridge. Chelsea's afternoon was summed up by Ba, who had a game to forget on his return to St James' Park. The Senegalese was booed from the start and ended up leaving the field before half-time with what was later confirmed to be a broken nose after taking a kick in the face from Coloccini. The injury occurred as Ba almost gave Chelsea the lead. He collected Lampard's throughball and, when his first effort was saved by Tim Krul, the ball bounced back to him and he headed inches wide, taking a whack in the process. Ba received lengthy treatment on the sidelines as blood streamed from his nose, although referee Howard Webb did not penalise the home defender. And no sooner had Ba returned to the field than Newcastle were ahead. The hosts had already tested Petr Cech on several occasions, with Papiss Cisse coming closest, but they made the breakthrough when Cabaye swept the ball out to Davide Santon and Gutierrez stole between the Chelsea defenders to head home. The goal marked a period of Newcastle dominance but that changed 10 minutes after the break when Lampard picked the ball up 30 yards from goal and arrowed it into the top corner to reach double figures in the Premier League for the 10th consecutive season. Mata's finish was equally exquisite, as he received substitute Fernando Torres's lay-off to curl past the stretching Krul and give the Blues the lead. Chelsea looked to be coping well without Ba, but Newcastle remained a threat on the break and from Gouffran's surging run they equalised, his shot parried as far as Sissoko, who turned it in. But the Frenchman saved his best for last, receiving Santon's cutback to beat Cech at his near post from 20 yards. Even then Lampard could have levelled once more, but his shot was blocked by Steven Taylor as Newcastle's French revolution gained an added dimension.

24.04.2013 23:34:21 Two goals from Jimmy Kebe helped Reading beat Sunderland as the Royals moved two points clear of the Premier League relegation zone. The Mali forward rifled in an early opener as the hosts dominated against a Black Cats side aiming to move into the top half of the table. Sunderland equalised through a Craig Gardner penalty after Pavel Pogrebnyak clumsily fouled John O'Shea. But Kebe towered above Gardner to meet Ian Harte's free-kick in a late twist.  Sunderland's new Â£5m striker Danny Graham forced home goalkeeper Adam Federici into a brilliant acrobatic save just seconds before Reading's winner. But instead, Kebe was the match-winner as Reading again showed their fighting qualities to clinch their third victory in four league matches. Reading's impressive recent form has been characterised by a steely resilience which has enabled them to cancel out deficits in each of the last four top-flight games. Before kick-off, Brian McDermott insisted he did not want his team to make a habit of going behind before a late rally - and they responded by taking an early lead in a dominant opening. Sunderland allowed Royals skipper Jobi McAnuff far too much space in the left channel of their penalty area and he picked out Kebe, who took a superb first touch which gave him space to rifle past Simon Mignolet. However, it looked as though Reading would have to be content with just a point. Sunderland had little possession in the first half-hour, but they were given a golden opportunity to gain a foothold in the match following Pogrebnyak's rash sliding challenge on visiting skipper O'Shea. Referee Lee Mason pointed to the spot and Gardner smashed a venomous spot-kick out of Federici's reach into the bottom left corner. Both teams lacked punch in a scrappy start to the second half and Royals boss McDermott reacted by introducing in-form striker Adam Le Fondre and new signing Nick Blackman.  Le Fondre had scored seven goals in his five previous matches, including a late brace which salvaged a point in a 2-2 draw against Chelsea on Wednesday, but it was still not enough to promote him into the Royals' starting XI. Sunderland counterpart Graham also had to be content with a place on the bench following his move from Swansea. And he almost made an instant impact after being introduced by Martin O'Neill with 10 minutes remaining. A huge roar from the travelling Sunderland fans greeted Graham, a boyhood Newcastle supporter who    and he was denied twice in quick succession. He rose to meet Adam Johnson's right-wing cross with a far-post header, only to be denied by a block by Reading defender Alex Pearce, before Federici made another brilliant save from the subsequent corner. Sunderland had not been beaten in their previous three league matches but Kebe pounced to keep the Black Cats out of the top 10, while Reading remain 17th but are two points clear of the relegation zone.  Reading manager Brian McDermott:  "It was a tough game. I thought we started well and scored the early goal before conceding the penalty. "We have talked in the dressing room about Jimmy Kebe's prowess in the air, which he thought was greatly amusing. But no-one's laughing today - it was a great finish and a great ball by Ian Harte. "We're absolutely delighted to get the three points."  Sunderland manager Martin O'Neill:  "My main emotion is one of disappointment. Conceding a goal so late in the match, coming off the back of a couple of decent chances, is frustrating. But we have to take it and look forward to the next match. "Reading adapted to the conditions better than we did and the pitch was firm and slippery on top. They started more brightly than we did and got the goal which they deserved. "We got back in through the penalty and from then on we were never out of the game. It could have gone either way, but to concede was very disappointing."

24.04.2013 23:34:21 Andy Carroll scored on his first start since November as West Ham defeated Swansea at Upton Park. The striker, on loan from Liverpool, grabbed the winner late in the second half, leaping highest to head in from close range. Swansea keeper Gerhard Tremmel made superb saves from Kevin Nolan, Ricardo Vaz Te and Carroll. The visitors created very few chances, with Michu heading over from six yards in the second half. The encounter was, at times, a slightly drab affair, interspersed with moments of brilliance, in particular from Tremmel, who kept his side in the game until Carroll got the better of him with 12 minutes to go. In the first half, the German, who arrived from Red Bull Salzburg in 2011, twice denied Nolan from close range and the 34-year-old also showed strong hands to block long-range efforts from Mohamed Diame and Vaz Te, who cut in from the right a let fly from 20 yards. After the interval, Tremmel had barely had time to settle into his area before he was tested again by Vaz Te - clinging on to the Portuguese winger's low effort. Carroll was at the heart of most of West Ham's attacks during the match. The 24-year-old, a substitute at Fulham in midweek, had set up both of Nolan's efforts and finally managed an effort of his own when he flashed a shot over from 15 yards. He came even closer to scoring moments later, when the Swans' keeper produced an outstanding block with his feet to keep out an angled low shot. But he was not to be denied a third time, leaping to head in Mark Noble's left-wing corner from six yards out. It was relief for the Hammers, who would have felt hard done by had they not taken all three points from this match. Swansea's best player was former Valencia winger Pablo Hernandez, who weaved his way into the area in the first half before seeing his shot blocked, and then delivered an inch-perfect ball for leading scorer Michu in the second, only for the Spaniard to head over. The visitors came close to snatching a point at the last, but Jussi Jaaskelainen, largely redundant in the home goal, made a brilliant one-handed stop to deny Jonathan de Guzman.  West Ham manager Sam Allardyce:  "I was wondering what the lads had to do to score a goal. We had a lot of balls flashing across the goal and over the bar. "Our defending has been our weaker point but we were very good. Swansea hardly created anything except in the last couple of minutes. It's a massive relief."  Swansea boss Michael Laudrup:  "It could have gone either way. They had two good chances in first half through Kevin Nolan. In the second half, they had couple of chances, but they weren't difficult to defend. "Carroll scored a great goal and was difficult to mark. We had two or three chances at end of game and should have created more from the positions we were in. "We could have, and should have, created a little more but didn't have that last pass. I'm not happy with losing, but we didn't do anything specifically wrong."

24.04.2013 23:34:21 Shaun Maloney's 90th-minute goal rescued a draw for relegation-threatened Wigan against fellow strugglers Southampton. The Latics led at the break courtesy of Gary Caldwell's header from 12 yards but Rickie Lambert nodded home from close range to level. Adam Lallana crashed a half-volley off the post for Saints before Morgan Schneiderlin's side-foot made it 2-1. But Maloney's late tap-in from two yards saw Wigan earn a vital point. The result keeps Wigan in the bottom three and two points from safety after Reading's victory against Sunderland.  Saints are three points better off and, while new manager Mauricio Pochettino is still searching for his first win, he would have been hugely encouraged by another dominant performance from his side, who came agonisingly close to victory. Wigan had the game's first chance with Saints keeper Artur Boruc pulling off a wonderful full-stretch save to deny striker Franco Di Santo, who prodded John Beausejour's low cross towards goal. At the other end Gaston Ramirez should have put Saints ahead but after timing his run to perfection he volleyed Lambert's cross over from 10 yards out. But Caldwell soon gave Wigan the lead, burying a header from Beausejour's corner into the bottom of the net from 12 yards. Schneiderlin almost pulled Saints level in bizarre fashion with his block from James McCarthy's clearance on the edge of the Wigan box rebounding towards goal before being superbly tipped over the bar by Ali Al Habsi. Jos Hooiveld went close with a header as Saints pressed hard for an equaliser but they found Caldwell and Paul Scharner in imperious form at the back, the Wigan defensive duo blocking and clearing everything thrown at them. But their resistance was eventually broken and Saints levelled through their talisman Lambert who bravely beat Al Habsi to the ball to head home from close range after fine work from Jack Cork on the right wing. Saints then came close to going ahead but Lallana's half-volley on the swivel crashed back off the post. Lambert volleyed wide from a Luke Shaw cross as the visitors continued to press for the winner. And it looked to have come through midfielder Schneiderlin, who side-footed home from close range after a rapid Saints break culminating in a fine run and cross from Rodriguez. But Wigan refused to give up and when Scharner got his head to a late corner, Maloney was there to scuff the ball over the line.  Wigan manager Roberto Martinez said:  "It's another point gained. It was vital. "We've played Southampton twice and got four points and that is a very good return. "It's vital to carry on picking up points. We have to get that consistency of picking up points and today gives me real satisfaction. "Paul Scharner was very impressive and he brought real intensity to our defending. He will be important to us between now and the end of the season. "We still have got many points to achieve and we have to use our experience of previous seasons."  Southampton boss Mauricio Pochettino:  "I'm happy with the performance but disappointed with the result but you always have to wait until the end of the match. "The players have accepted my style very much. I'm sad for the players and thank the supporters. "Little by little I'm learning (the language) but it will be a slow process. Body language is as important as actual language."

24.04.2013 23:34:21 Norwich City goalkeeper Mark Bunn's second-half penalty save from Adel Taarabt earned his side a point against Premier League bottom club QPR. The Canaries were furious about the award after Bunn felled Jamie Mackie, but the keeper made a fine diving save from the otherwise impressive Taarabt. Taarabt also went close with two long-range strikes. But home keeper Julio Cesar was forced to make several decent saves in a thrilling second half to earn the draw. Despite stretching the improving QPR's unbeaten league run to five games, the visitors will be happier with a result that lifts them seven points away from the relegation zone. Harry Redknapp's R's, who have drawn their last four top-flight games, are now six points adrift of safety following Saturday's league programme. Ultimately both sides were punished for their lack of quality in front of goal - something both managers had sought to address in the transfer window. Redknapp and Norwich counterpart Chris Hughton had clearly been set on bolstering their respective attacks. Hughton's numerous attempts to bring in Celtic's Gary Hooper proved unsuccessful, however, while Redknapp's much-publicised courtship of West Brom's Peter Odemwingie also ended in failure. And how both sides could have done with a cutting edge during a dismal and disjointed first half littered with errors. A promising enough start soon petered out with the only serious first-half entertainment provided by the supremely-talented Taarabt. Redknapp, deprived of the services of injured striker Loic Remy, has given playmaker Taarabt the freedom his ability demands and he showed flashes of his class in the opening 45 minutes. The Moroccan's best effort saw him use his strength and quick feet to beat three men before firing a low shot narrowly wide. Norwich should have scored in the first few minutes when Wes Hoolahan could only divert a teasing Robert Snodgrass cross over the bar from close range. But apart from that and a tame Snodgrass header they barely threatened. Thankfully a much improved second half followed. A delicious Taarabt free-kick, played across the face of the six-yard box, eluded everyone within seconds of the restart and the chances continued throughout. Cesar made a fabulous one-handed reaction save to keep out Hoolahan's close-range flicked effort after a fine cross from Snodgrass, and also made a decent stop from Bradley Johnson. Taarabt still seemed the most likely scorer but was guilty of wasting the hosts' best chance from the spot. His penalty, awarded as Mackie tumbled when caught by Bunn after a poor Javier Garrido backpass, was well struck but the keeper dived low to his left to turn the ball away. Taarabt tried to make amends but was off target with a 20-yard free-kick and then forced a messy save from Bunn, who just about kept out a swerving strike.  Record-signing Christopher Samba, who was steady and assured at the back, also had a header cleared by Grant Holt on the goalline and Clint Hill and Bobby Zamora both had headed opportunities. As the game reached its closing stages a decent long-range Snodgrass strike forced one final save from Cesar while Samba's fellow debutant Andros Townsend also tested the excellent Bunn from distance. But Norwich, who gave a debut to new signing Luciano Becchio as a late substitute, were able to hold on for just their third point in the last eight games.  QPR manager Harry Redknapp:  "I felt if we had scored the penalty, we would have gone on and won the game. "Of course we need wins, but we could not have tried any harder - we gave everything. "I couldn't have asked for more. We just needed a break. We just need to turn draws into wins. We're unbeaten since the turn of the year so we've just got to keep going."  Norwich City manager Chris Hughton:  "Every point away from home in this division is a good point, especially against a team in form. "We knew it was going to be a tough game, but I thought a draw was a fair result. "We are a hard-working team who were always going to have a tough season, so it is all about assessing the games and coming good again. "At the moment, although we are not picking up three points, we have played out two good draws and the gap between us and the bottom three is very important."

24.04.2013 23:34:21 Fulham fought back after squandering an early lead to beat West Ham at Craven Cottage. A header from Dimitar Berbatov saw Fulham take the lead after 10 minutes despite suspicions of offside. Kevin Nolan reacted to a quickly-taken free-kick to equalise just after half-time but Hugo Rodallega's header restored Fulham's lead within a minute. Mladen Petric's shot from a tight angle went in off West Ham's Joey O'Brien to secure the win in stoppage time. The result saw Fulham leapfrog over West Ham, now without a win since New Year's Day, to ease worries after a run that had seen Martin Jol's side slip down the table. The game's first chance came after less than 30 seconds when Joe Cole spurned a good opportunity to shoot wide, but it was the home side who took the lead after just 10 minutes. Damien Duff's free-kick from the right of the West Ham box floated over a packed penalty area, before flicking off Brede Hangeland's chest to the lurking Berbatov on the far post. The Bulgarian nodded the ball past Jaaskelainen for a simple goal but, together with the West Ham defence, he looked to the officials to check whether he would be flagged for offside. Despite replays suggesting that he was, the goal stood to give Berbatov his eighth of the season. The former Manchester United striker, celebrating his 32nd birthday, was at his languid best as Fulham held their visitors at bay on the cushion of the early goal. Bryan Ruiz and Rodallega built on neat work from Berbatov in several moves, with Ruiz drilling a shot at Jaaskelainen, who also reacted quickly to dive at Rodallega's feet to snuff out another chance. Cole's early miss apart, West Ham's only other chance of note in the first half came on the half-hour, when Kevin Nolan saw his close-range header bounce a yard wide of the post. Berbatov continued to pose a threat, going on a loping run late in the first half before shaving the post with his shot from just outside the area. West Ham looked like a different side in the opening exchanges of the second half, and they were level three minutes after the re-start when Kevin Nolan span away from Berbatov at a quickly-taken free-kick to shoot home from an angle. But Fulham hit back immediately through Rodallega, who climbed above two West Ham defenders to head a Damien Duff cross past Jaaskelainen. The flurry of goals roused both sides, with Mark Schwarzer making a fine save low to his left to deny another angled effort from Nolan. Berbatov was in the action again with a shot flashing across Jaaskelainen, but after appearing to tweak a hamstring his contribution ended with 15 minutes remaining. Andy Carroll went close to marking his first taste of action since 28 November with a goal within a few seconds of replacing midfielder Cole, forcing Schwarzer into action with a low shot from the edge of the area. But the hosts held firm and they sealed their three points on 90 minutes when Petric, who had replaced Berbatov, saw his shot from the tightest of angles finally roll in off the unlucky O'Brien.  Fulham manager Martin Jol said : "West Ham were two points above us, so we needed this win. We had some good games lately, but could not get the results. We had a lot of draws, we should have won the Swansea game so we were struggling. "We had to play Man City and Man United away from home, and we've got to play United again on Saturday which is not going to be easy for us. In between we had to play West Ham, and we did what we had to do tonight. "They were very important, vital points to us and it was vital to them as well. I'm happy because we got the points, and we're on 28 points now."  West Ham assistant manager Neil McDonald said : "We work very hard in training that when we do score we have to keep it tight, unfortunately we didn't stop the cross and we let him (Rodallega) get his chance which was disappointing for us. We very rarely concede goals like that. "We have a lot of positives to take, we created a lot of chances and we have people coming back, which adds to the squad and hopefully we'll have better results in the remaining games."

24.04.2013 23:34:21 Wayne Rooney scored twice as Manchester United opened up a seven-point gap at the top of the Premier League with a comeback victory over Southampton. Rooney's first-half double put United in control after calamitous defending had led to Jay Rodriguez's third-minute opener for the visitors. Although the hosts threatened to overrun the Saints before the break, Mauricio Pochettino's side recovered well in the second half, pressing their hosts from the front. Rickie Lambert could even have equalised as his accurate shooting twice tested David de Gea, although Robin van Persie was also denied by Artur Boruc and had another effort ruled out for offside. An open and intriguing contest, this was another example of United being saved by their attack and, while they ultimately took advantage of neighbours Manchester City's failure to win at QPR on Tuesday, there will again be questions about their defending, particularly with Real Madrid visiting soon in the Champions League. Defeat for Southampton ended a six-game unbeaten run, although there were signs of a tactical adjustment to the team from Argentine coach Pochettino, in his second game since replacing Nigel Adkins. The 40-year-old was certainly true to his pre-match word in going for a win at a venue where Saints have not succeeded in 25 years. Having earned a draw and a clean sheet in his first game against Everton, Pochettino's start to Premier League life looked even rosier within three minutes as Rodriguez capitalised on Michael Carrick's poor backpass and nipped in ahead of the stranded De Gea to put the Saints in front. It was a shocking goal to concede and the 12th Premier League game in which United have gone behind this season. But, as on the eight other occasions when they have turned a deficit into victory, they recovered quickly. Within six minutes they were level. The ball fell to Kagawa 35 yards from goal and he threaded a pass to Rooney, who calmly passed the ball into the net past Boruc. It was a breathless start to the game, with United committed to attack in a 4-2-4 formation, and they could easily have scored twice before they finally got their second goal before the half-hour mark with Kagawa also hitting the post. Van Persie returned to the side after sitting out the FA Cup win over Fulham and caused havoc with a succession of fizzing free-kicks. From one of them, just before the half-hour, the Dutchman sent the ball to the back post where Patrice Evra nodded it back for Rooney to tuck in from a yard out. Danny Welbeck and Van Persie could have added further goals before the interval, and with Southampton also throwing men forward, there was no shortage of space. The introduction of Adam Lallana and Steven Davis brought a measure of control to the visitors' midfield after the break and Lambert, quiet to that point, twice gave De Gea something to think about with long-range shots. The hosts endured a slack spell, giving the ball away several times and De Gea fumbled another Lambert effort. It was enough to get Ferguson off his seat and he eventually brought on Rio Ferdinand to replace the struggling Chris Smalling. Van Persie might have had cause for complaint after his header from Rooney's cross was ruled out for offside, but the hosts and their supporters were relieved enough to hear the final whistle as Southampton ended the game strongly.  Manchester United boss Alex Ferguson told BBC Sport: "[Winning] is the name of the game at this stage of the season. "For the first 30 minutes I thought we were fantastic, we played really well. But in the second half Southampton have been the best team to play here this season. "We were fortunate to win the game. They pushed on top of us and didn't give us any time on the ball."  Southampton boss Mauricio Pochettino, speaking through a translator, told BBC Sport: "I'm very proud [of Ferguson's praise]. It's very important for my players to hear. But we leave with no points. We did play well but I'm upset at not getting a draw at least. It doesn't console me. "I think in the second half we played as we should have done for the whole game. I think it's important for the team to know we can play that well."
