Fulham finished the half strongly and had a couple of chances to draw level before the break as first Aaron Hughes directed a header at Southampton keeper Paulo Gazzaniga, before Hooiveld was caught out by a long ball into the area and Hugo Rodallega almost capitalised, but could only poke a shot wide of goal.
