Manchester United wrapped up a 20th league title in convincing style after Robin van Persie's first-half hat-trick sank Aston Villa. The Dutch striker has been United's stellar striker for much of the season before labouring of late after two goals in his previous seven Premier League appearances. But the ??24m summer signing returned to form in spectacular fashion to secure the silverware with four games to spare. Defeat for Manchester City at Tottenham on Sunday meant that United knew before kick-off that victory would be enough for them to cross the line. Despite an improved second-half showing by Villa, now three points above the relegation zone with four games remaining, that outcome never seriously looked in doubt. United boss Sir Alex Ferguson has now won the Premier League 13 times but the manner and margin of this triumph, a year after seeing the title wrenched from his grasp by City with the last kick of the season, should give him as much satisfaction as his first success. His side were already 13 points clear before kick-off, and there was an air of expectation bordering on euphoria at Old Trafford. If there were any nerves too, they went out of the window when Van Persie opened the scoring after 83 seconds. A move started by Wayne Rooney ended with Ryan Giggs knocking Antonio Valencia's cross into the path of the Dutchman, who converted from two yards out. It was an ominous start for a defence looking as vulnerable as Villa's, and more chances swiftly followed. The visitors escaped when Van Persie headed over and Rafael fired against the post but a second goal was not far away. Villa had just started to gain a foothold in the match, with Christian Benteke firing just over after a quick break, when United struck again in devastating fashion after 13 minutes. This time it was the home side on the counter-attack, and Rooney's searching ball found Van Persie running to meet it on the edge of the area to smash an unstoppable left-footed volley past Brad Guzan. It was a world-class strike worthy of putting the seal on a title that has been in United's grasp since early February, when they first moved 12 points clear, but he and United did not stop there. Giggs ran on to Shinji Kagawa's pass and had a chance to let fly himself, but instead set up Van Persie, who steadied himself before firing high into the roof of the net. His 31-minute hat-trick not only put the win and the title beyond doubt, it also moved the summer signing to 24 league goals - one above Liverpool's Luis Suarez as the Premier League's leading scorer. At that stage Villa's prime concern was damage limitation, especially because goal difference could yet play a part in their fight for survival, but to their credit they regrouped for the second half. It took a goal-line clearance from Van Persie to stop Andreas Weimann from pulling a goal back and David De Gea was called into action to keep out Benteke's low shot. United's players could be forgiven for having their minds on the parade to come at the final whistle, and even with the encouragement of Ferguson on the touchline, they failed to hit the heights they had managed before half-time. Villa went close again when Weimann curled an effort wide from the right of the box and, even when United did respond, Kagawa wasted an easy chance to make it 4-0 when he fired over with the goal gaping. The spirit shown by Paul Lambert's side bodes well for their battle against the drop. But it only succeeded in taking the edge off the celebrations from the home fans in the stands during the second half. They made up for it at the final whistle when the ground let out a collective roar of delight. Ferguson embraced his players as they completed a lap of honour - one they will repeat on 12 May after their game against Swansea when they will be handed the Premier League trophy. 


West Ham's clinical victory over Wigan appeared to end any lingering worries they had about relegation but caused further anxiety for the Latics. The irrepressible Shaun Maloney had an effort stopped by Jussi Jaaskelainen before Matt Jarvis was fortunate to find the bottom corner from his cross. Wigan had a host of chances after the break with James McArthur closest. Kevin Nolan's late volley then came against the run of play, keeping Wigan in the Premier League's bottom three. Andy Carroll fired wide with a late effort after latching onto a long ball from the back, for what would have been a truly unrepresentative scoreline. But Wigan will feel frustrated by their inability to make their second-half dominance count, wasting a chance to close in on relegation rivals Aston Villa who play Manchester United on Monday. Villa sit three points above Wigan, but with Stoke and Sunderland both winning, it was a poor day for Latics boss Roberto Martinez who last weekend watched his side secure a place in the FA Cup final. Thoughts about that occasion must now be put to one side as the Spaniard aims to secure his team's Premier League safety, starting with the visit of Tottenham next Saturday. His position is far different from West Ham boss Sam Allardyce, whose team are now five league games unbeaten and sit 11 points above the relegation zone with four games left. In what turned out to be a reflection of the game, Wigan enjoyed a dominant spell of possession in the first 20 minutes. Maloney began brightly and had the the visitors' best chance to open the scoring when he was slipped through the middle by Callum McManaman, but Jaaskelainen was quick to come off his line and save the Scot's effort. West Ham appeared content to remain compact rather than chase the ball and before the goal they were limited in their attacking forays. In contrast to Wigan's short-sharp passing, Carroll was eager to profit from any set-pieces and he went into the book early on for what looked like a petty reaction to Gary Caldwell's attentions. That was soon forgotten, though, when the Hammers took the lead as Jarvis advanced down the left, cut back, and his cross carried all the way into the bottom corner as Mohamed Diame attempted to poke it in against his former club. The goal gave the hosts an instant boost and Carroll increased his influence while Nolan had a penalty appeal waved away by referee Neil Swarbrick. Wigan recovered after the break when Martinez's decision to replace McManaman with McArthur allowed Jordi Gomez to play further forward and the Spanish midfielder tested Jaaskelainen. Efforts from Emmerson Boyce, McArthur and Jean Beausejour were all then saved by West Ham's Finnish goalkeeper, with another to deny McArthur following Maloney's cut-back the best of the bunch. Maloney was a menace in the second half and Allardyce's team struggled to get out of their own half, much to the home supporters' frustration. But they were soon singing their famous 'I'm forever blowing bubbles' song when from a long-free-kick, Carroll chested the ball down, hooked it over his head and Nolan stole in to volley his 100th career goal.  West Ham boss Sam Allardyce: "While it wasn't the best performance, the bottom line is, if you score your goals and take your chances, you win football matches. "Their possession was better than ours but the chances they had they either missed or Jussi Jaaskelainen saved them. We knew Wigan would push forward which left them defensively weakened and we exposed them." 


Substitute Adam Le Fondre scored a late double as Reading fought back from two behind against Chelsea to climb out of the Premier League relegation zone. Blues midfielder Juan Mata opened the scoring in first-half injury-time with a fierce strike across Adam Federici. Frank Lampard's thumping header from Mata's corner put third-placed Chelsea firmly in command at the Madejski. But Le Fondre fired in Hope Akpan's pass before guiding in a stoppage-time leveller in a dramatic finale. Reading knew they only needed a point to move above relegation rivals Wigan and Aston Villa out of the bottom three, but seemed set to remain in danger as Chelsea took command. However, the Royals were rescued once again by Le Fondre, who also came off the bench to score twice in six minutes in their 2-1 win at Newcastle.  The introduction of fellow substitute Akpan, a recent signing from League One side Crawley Town, also proved instrumental as he provided both goals for Le Fondre. His clever throughball enabled Le Fondre to fire past stand-in Chelsea goalkeeper Ross Turnbull, again replacing the injured Petr Cech, at his near post. Turnbull had not even been forced into a save before Le Fondre's first and was left stunned as the ex-Rotherham striker earned Reading an unlikely point in the fifth minute of stoppage time. Home goalkeeper Federici launched a long free-kick into the Chelsea box and the visiting defence, minus John Terry who was on the bench, failed to cope with the high ball. It allowed Jimmy Kebe, and then Akpan, to head into the path of Le Fondre, who managed to keep his composure and score his seventh goal in five matches. Chelsea were left stunned by the double salvo, which will crank up the pressure on Blues boss Rafael Benitez - again the target of jeers from the away supporters. The visitors were firmly on course to secure their fifth successive top-flight victory on the road and reduce the deficit on second-placed Manchester City to four points. A dull first-half sparked into life 50 seconds into stoppage-time as Reading were carved open by a slick one-touch move from the visitors. Ramires, Oscar and Mata combined for Fernando Torres to scoop the ball into the path of fellow Spaniard Mata who swept a low half-volley across Federici into his bottom left-hand corner. Before Mata's goal, Chelsea's only periods of sustained pressure came after mistakes from Reading carelessly handed possession back to Blues. And another error allowed Lampard to burst forward as Chelsea forced the corner which led to his goal. It was the England midfielder's 10th goal of the season and puts him just six goals adrift of Bobby Tambling's all-time record of 202 goals for the west London club. Brazilian midfielder Oscar could have added a third when he was released by substitute Yossi Benayoun's pass, only to be denied by the on-rushing Federici. And it proved costly as Le Fondre intervened to earn Reading's seventh point from their last three Premier League games.  Reading boss Brian McDermott:  "You definitely didn't see that coming. But we've had it here at the Madejski before with 10 minutes to go. We've done it so many times. "We weren't really in the game, just trying to get a foothold and trying to change things to get something. "Hope Akpan came on the pitch and made a couple of goals too. He was terrific. "That's why we talk about the group and what they all mean to us. They all made a difference for us today." 


Arsenal rescued a point with a stirring comeback after Liverpool looked like they would recover from their shock FA Cup defeat by Oldham with victory at Emirates Stadium. Luis Suarez and Jordan Henderson took full advantage of an Arsenal defensive display that plumbed the depths to put Brendan Rodgers's side on course for victory after an hour. But Arsenal showed great resolve to respond swiftly and score twice inside three minutes through Olivier Giroud and Theo Walcott and ensure a thrilling game ended in a draw. Liverpool will be disappointed at conceding that two-goal advantage while Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger may regard a point as a relief, such was the generosity of the defending that presented the visitors with so many opportunities. Defender Martin Skrtel paid the price for Liverpool's FA Cup loss at League One Oldham as he was dropped in favour of Jamie Carragher. If Carragher's presence was designed to give Liverpool's rearguard more security, Arsenal spent the first 45 minutes producing such an utterly chaotic defensive shambles that they were lucky not to be punished more heavily than they were. The tone was set when Liverpool took the lead after five minutes. Bacary Sagna fell over as Suarez missed a flick and when Arsenal failed to clear after Wojciech Szczesny saved from Daniel Sturridge, the Uruguayan scored with the help of a deflection. Liverpool keeper Pepe Reina prevented Arsenal equalising instantly as he blocked a Walcott effort at his near post - and it was not long before Suarez was creating more havoc for Arsenal. He released Sturridge with a magical swerving pass with the outside of his foot but his strike partner chose to take the chance first time and rolled his effort tamely wide. Walcott was Arsenal's main danger and he forced another excellent diving save from Reina, but any good work the Gunners were doing in attack was being badly undermined by a succession of calamities at the other end. Lukas Podolski cleared Daniel Agger's header off the line and Henderson landed an effort on the roof of the net with Szczesny stranded out of his ground trying to rescue another desperate situation. Arsenal had suffered a blow when the luckless Kieran Gibbs limped off to be replaced by Andre Santos but there could be no excuse for the standard of defending that had presented Liverpool with so much space and opportunity. There was no escape for Arsenal as Liverpool doubled their lead on the hour. In a moment that encapsulated the game to that point, Henderson battled his way past four home defenders in the area before rolling home a goal his determination deserved. Arsenal, perhaps in desperation, suddenly roused themselves and were level within seven minutes. Giroud powered in a close-range header then Walcott got his reward with a fine angled shot that carried too much pace and power for Reina. As both sides continued to attack, Santi Cazorla flashed a shot across the face of goal and Reina excelled once more as he dived to his right to save from Giroud. Giroud was then unable to complete Arsenal's recovery and put them ahead as he failed to make firm contact with Podokski's cross fromsix yards out. Liverpool had a chance of their own in stoppage time when Santos, unsurprisingly, gifted the visitors possession in a dangerous area and it took a sharp stop from Szczesny to deny Suarez and ensure Arsenal's recovery earned them a point.  Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger: "We created many chances going forward but were nervous defensively. The goals we have conceded show we were nervous from the start. "It was entertainment. We could honestly have lost the game but could have won it by three or four goals."  Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers: "There is an initial disappointment when you are 2-0 up [and draw] but we knew Arsenal were going to have a spell. "We could have had a few more goals but my overriding emotion is one of pride. These players have been brilliant."
