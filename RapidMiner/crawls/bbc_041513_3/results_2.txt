23.04.2013 09:50:57 Manchester United moved to within seven points of securing a 20th league title with a routine win that pushed Stoke further towards the relegation zone. Robin van Persie made sure of the points with a second-half penalty that ended a run of 10 games without a goal.  That came after Michael Carrick had given United the perfect start, prodding home from a scrappy corner. The result leaves Stoke only three points above the bottom three, having won two of the last 17 league matches. This was a performance and victory typical of United's season, one that owed more to perspiration than inspiration. With it, Sir Alex Ferguson's side once again open up a 15-point gap at the top of the Premier League. Stoke, however, are falling down the division. One victory in their past 14 matches, one clean sheet in 15 league games, one point from seven matches - the statistics read like relegation form for Tony Pulis's men. And while a defeat by United may not decide their fate, crucial matches against Queens Park Rangers, Norwich and Sunderland in the weeks ahead, almost certainly will. Ferguson took nothing for granted, however. Consecutive defeats by Manchester City and Chelsea had hurt, but from the moment Carrick put United ahead there was never a chance of the champions elect losing a third successive match for the first time since May 2001. United's attacking line-up bristled with attacking menace - Shinji Kagawa provided the vision, Wayne Rooney the craft from deep and Van Persie the quick feet and eye for goal. Yet, when the opening goal did come, it was from an altogether more straightforward source, as Carrick toe-poked a low shot into the bottom corner after Van Persie's right-wing corner had been helped on by Phil Jones. It was United's 100th goal of the season and it seemed the 101st would follow soon after, as Rooney stung Asmir Begovic's palms with a rasping drive and then fizzed a free-kick just wide of the goalkeeper's right-hand post as half-time approached. But Stoke tackled, battled, denied space - Robert Huth heading a free-kick a yard wide and Kenwyne Jones making a nuisance of himself. The work-rate was admirable too, City players often doubling up on United's main threats like Kagawa, while Van Persie found he had unwelcome, unstinting company. Jonathan Walters scooped his shot over early in the second half, United goalkeeper David de Gea held a drilled effort from Charlie Adam before Jones rifled another effort over, but United weathered the storm. Van Persie found space to collect Hernandez's clever pass, only to steer his shot into the side-netting from a tight angle. If that was a warning shot, the decisive strike came soon after. Once again Van Persie found space, he bedazzled Andy Wilkinson by cutting in, feinting and twitching his way into the box, where he was brought down by the Stoke defender for a clear penalty. The wind blew the ball off the spot as Van Persie stepped up to end his 751-minute goal drought, but the Dutchman would not be denied, tucking his shot low beyond Begovic's left hand and into the corner of the net. He ran to Ferguson on the touchline, where the pair embraced knowing the league title is almost United's.  Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson:  "We are a game closer - the important thing is not to take our eye off the ball. Coming here is always a difficult game, with the wind blowing the ball all over the place. But the players stood up to that, they persevered and it was an important victory.  Robin [Van Persie] showed fantastic composure and concentration and he hit the perfect penalty - it was a great celebration. I thought Wayne Rooney looked very confident, he needs a little boost in his confidence. He is like any other player that doesn't hit the heights that people expect, or that he sets for himself, he needs a little confidence boost."  Stoke manager Tony Pulis:  "We shot ourselves in the foot. We conceded from a set piece early on, that just settled United and that took the steam out of us. For the second goal, the penalty, if Andy [Wilkinson] stays on his feet you've always got a chance at 1-0. Two poor goals have just killed the game for us. "

23.04.2013 09:50:58 Paolo Di Canio's reign as Sunderland manager began with a defeat at Chelsea that leaves The Black Cats deep in the fight to stay in the Premier League. The Italian had the start he wanted when Cesar Azpilicueta's own goal gave Sunderland a surprise lead moments before half-time. Sunderland's renewed optimism was short-lived, however, as Chelsea were in front 10 minutes after the interval as a result of another own goal, this time a deflection off Matt Kilgallon, and Branislav Ivanovic's touch on a David Luiz shot. Di Canio, watching with his flamboyant gestures and constant interaction with his players and backroom staff, will provide a compelling spectacle in the tense closing phases of the season. There is no doubt, however, that Sunderland are in serious trouble despite the effort and fight shown here. For all this, they look desperately short of attacking inspiration. And Sunday's Tyne-Wear derby against Newcastle United at St. James' Park now assumes even greater importance. Chelsea's interim manager Rafael Benitez can reflect on a highly satisfactory week, with an important victory to move the Blues up to third in the Premier League, following on from wins against Manchester United in the FA Cup and Rubin Kazan in the Europa League. Di Canio's entrance was understated, with a polite wave in response to a warm reception from Sunderland's fans and an embrace from John Terry as the Chelsea captain took his place on the substitutes' bench. It was not long, however, before he was an animated figure in his technical area, in regular dialogue with his backroom team, bellowing instructions to his players and even giving defender Phil Bardsley a robust slap on the cheek at one point - a slap of encouragement, it should be stressed. Sunderland acquitted themselves well in the opening half as they restricted Chelsea's chances, and then took the lead seconds before the break. John O'Shea directed Adam Johnson's corner towards goal and Azpilicueta made a hash of his attempted clearance, sending a slice into his own net. Benitez responded at the start of the second half with the introduction of Fernando Torres for Demba Ba, who struggled after a heavy challenge that earned Craig Gardner a booking which will rule him out of next Sunday's game at Newcastle. It was a change that brought instant dividends as Chelsea drew level with another messy goal. The striker, playing in a mask after suffering a broken nose, produced a surge of pace to find Oscar, whose shot ended in the net via Sunderland keeper Simon Mignolet and Kilgallon, who was debited with the own goal. Chelsea were ahead after 55 minutes, with Ivanovic reacting quickly to divert Luiz's long-range shot out of the reach of Mignolet. Sunderland struggled to recover from Chelsea's response and it was no surprise when Di Canio made his first change with 20 minutes left, sending on James McClean for Seb Larsson. But there was to be no late rescue act as Di Canio was given an illustration of the task awaiting him as he attempts to preserve Sunderland's Premier League status. Despite the defeat, the Black Cats remain outside of the bottom three but only on goal difference as 18th-placed Wigan picked up a point at QPR.   Chelsea interim manager Rafael Benitez:  "We needed to improve after the break obviously. The negative thing is we conceded a goal, the positive thing is we recovered and came back. "In the last 15 minutes we were a bit under pressure, but after four games in eight days that has to be expected. "Sunderland have a new manager, they were compact and organised so it was not easy to find space. Some players are a bit tired, but after so many games it is not easy and you have to change players."

23.04.2013 09:50:58 David Silva scored twice as Manchester City saw off Fulham to close the gap on leaders Manchester United to four points, for 24 hours at least. United can restore their seven-point advantage when they go to Tottenham on Sunday but City succeeded in their mission of putting pressure on their title rivals before their tough test in north London. This was a straightforward enough victory for the champions, rather than the scintillating one it threatened to be when Silva put his side ahead after just 95 seconds, but the three points were what mattered for Roberto Mancini's men. Fulham rarely posed a serious threat other than when Steve Sidwell headed against the post in the first half but City did not make the points safe until Silva struck his second in the 69th minute. The Cottagers' form - two wins in their last 14 games - had suggested an easy afternoon for the hosts, who certainly made the perfect start. They opened the scoring after James Milner darted in to win possession, allowing Edin Dzeko to fire in a 25-yard shot that Mark Schwarzer could only parry into the path of Silva. Martin Jol's side are not known for their resistance, especially on the road, but against expectations they dug in after going behind. With City bogged down in midfield, and careless in possession, the Cottagers began to venture forward and fired a succession of crosses into Joe Hart's area. The home side were still threatening and had glimpses of goal when Dzeko and Carlos Tevez both brought routine saves out of Schwarzer. But Fulham came within inches of levelling when Damien Duff's cross was met by Sidwell, who was under pressure from Pablo Zabaleta but still managed to send the ball looping against the outside of the woodwork. On the touchline, Mancini's frustration was obvious, and the home fans were also becoming exasperated by City's wasteful play. City badly needed a second goal but continued to give the ball away in promising positions, although Dzeko did go close before half-time with a whipped shot from Tevez's pull-back. Things improved in the second half, with the hard-working Tevez firing over and Kompany going close with a header from a corner. Fulham were by this stage offering little at the other end but still retained hope of snatching a point until Silva made sure of his side's victory. The Spanish playmaker started the move that led to the goal, and finished it too - running on to Tevez's clever dummy from Gael Clichy's pass to dink the ball over Schwarzer. He should have completed his hat-trick moments later when Tevez sent him running clear, but this time he rolled his shot wide. Even so, there was no way back for Fulham, and City could afford to miss more chances before the end - most notably a howler from Dzeko, who lifted the ball over the bar from six yards out.  Man City assistant manager David Platt: "I thought our performance in the second half got much better. I thought we defended well as a team, but in the second half we started to create more opportunities to score. "David Silva had a great time last season and his recent performances have been very good. He does great things for us, but he has missed the goals his performances deserve. He got two today, and should have had three. "Towards the end we could have got three or four, and a clean sheet is great."  Fulham boss Martin Jol: "We made plans and train to do whatever we want, but to concede in the second minute is a horrific scenario. At 1-0 down it could have been a horrible day. "After they scored we did better, but the final ball wasn't great. If you want something here at Man City you need a bit of luck and quality, but we couldn't find that special moment. That was disappointing. "We could have hurt them because they didn't score their second until the 70th minute and this wasn't Man City at their best."

23.04.2013 09:50:58 Adam Le Fondre came off the bench to score twice in six minutes as Reading completed a superb turnaround to beat struggling Newcastle. The hosts were well on top and took a first-half lead when the impressive Yohan Cabaye curled in a free-kick. But after Pavel Pogrebnyak went close, Le Fondre scored with his first touch, turning in Jimmy Kebe's low cross. And he earned Reading's first away win of the season when he gathered Kebe's nod-down to steer past Tim Krul. The comeback was reminiscent of Reading's incredible effort against West Brom last Saturday when they came from 2-0 down to win 3-2 with Le Fondre also playing a key part. Their first victory at Newcastle boosted the Premier League survival chances of Brian McDermott's side, leaving the Magpies without a win in six games. Just two points now separate the teams and, as much as the three points will encourage the Royals, it will also depress a Newcastle side who were on top for large parts of this match. Much of that was down to Cabaye, making his first start for Newcastle since 11 November, during which time Alan Pardew's side have won twice in 11 Premier League games. But Reading capitalised as he tired, and was eventually withdrawn to boos from the home supporters, to win for the third time in four league games. Cabaye's passing and well timed breaks forward had the Reading midfield turning from the start and it kept the visitors' defence busy too. After testing Federici from long distance, the France midfielder delightfully picked out Papiss Cisse with a flighted diagonal pass but the Australian keeper clawed away the striker's header. Cisse had two further efforts but again Federici did exceptionally to keep them out. Reading were willing to let Newcastle dominate possession and break on the counter and they almost took the lead when a sweeping move ended in Pogrebnyak sliding the ball wide from 12 yards from Garath McCleary's cross. Despite Newcastle's probing, Reading were proving tough to break down but that changed when Cabaye carved them open to take the lead. It was his pass that led to the free-kick, from which he stepped up to nonchalantly curl the ball over the wall and beyond Federici. Reading have struggled away from home all season but were inches from equalising via a Jonas Gutierrez own goal shortly after the interval when Ian Harte's free-kick clipped the Argentine's knee and fizzed past the far post. With snow showers continuing at St James' Park, the visitors did not look like scoring until Le Fondre, so often a threat from the bench in Reading's promotion push last season, was introduced. The substitute was on the field for less than a minute before he bundled home Kebe's low right-wing cross as the ball bounced off his chest. Le Fondre did not know much about it as he slid in after Mike Williamson missed the ball, but it was his ninth goal of the season and he reached double figures six minutes later. This time Jobi McAnuff crossed from the left, Kebe nodded it back and although debutant Hope Akpan miscued, it fell to former Rotherham striker Le Fondre, who squeezed the ball past Krul at the near post. Newcastle struggled to respond and their second half was summed up when Cisse beat the offside trap to fire horribly over from 10 yards.  Reading boss Brian McDermott: "We've looked at our away record and we've been in games, we've learned that you have to try and manage games at this level. We went to 4-4-2 to try and win the game, and I felt at 1-1 we had a major chance of doing it. "But when you have Adam Le Fondre coming off the bench like that, the second goal was top-drawer finish. A couple of years ago he was playing for Rotherham and what he is doing now for us, I'm just so proud of him."

23.04.2013 09:50:58 Two strikes from Jonathan de Guzman and Ben Davies's first goal saw Swansea secure a comprehensive win over Stoke. After a goalless first half Davies broke the deadlock when he fired a low shot past Asmir Begovic. De Guzman doubled the lead with a curling free-kick before completing a fine Swans move with an accomplished finish to make it three. Michael Owen's late header, his first goal for Stoke, was a mere consolation for the visitors. Stoke offered very little but the win will give Swansea confidence for their Capital One Cup semi-final second leg against Chelsea on Wednesday. The Swans made a probing start to the game with Michu firing high and wide after being teed up by Itay Shechter, who capitalised on a mistake by Robert Huth. Stoke found it hard to break out of their own half during the early exchanges but gradually improved. Despite their promising start the home side did not trouble Asmir Begovic, with Ki's long-range effort clearing the crossbar. In reply Peter Crouch, making his first league start since November, volleyed over the bar. Matthew Etherington found himself in the area after playing a neat one-two with Charlie Adam but the winger fired into the side-netting. Swansea upped their game as Pablo Hernandez and Davies saw efforts deflected, and Ki turned an effort wide of the post. The best move of what had been a forgettable first half saw Michu head wide from six yards following Angel Rangel's neat cross from the right. And De Guzman missed another excellent opportunity when he fluffed his shot after Wayne Routledge's cross found him in a packed penalty area. De Guzman again had his sights on goal early in the second half but the Dutchman blazed his effort over the bar. But two minutes later Swansea finally broke the deadlock courtesy of a first senior goal for 19-year-old full-back Davies. The Wales international showed strength and composure as he beat two players before coolly slotting the ball past Begovic. Michael Laudrup's side were now fully in control and when Michu was brought down on the edge of the area by Adam, De Guzman curled the free-kick into the net, beyond a stranded Begovic. New Swans loan signing Roland Lamah was introduced as a  replacement for Hernandez while Stoke's Kenwyne Jones, a possible Swansea target, replaced Crouch. Another substitute, Cameron Jerome missed a golden chance to reduce the deficit when he put the ball over from a yard out. The hosts completed the win when De Guzman finished off a sweeping move with an accomplished finish 10 minutes from time after receiving a pass from Danny Graham. Owen scored with a header from six yards for his first goal in Stoke colours but it was too late to prevent the Swans moving four points clear of their visitors and into eighth place in the Premier League.  Swansea City manager Michael Laudrup:  "We dominated from the first minute. In the first half Stoke had to defend very deep and the only bad point was we did not score from the two or three good chances we had. "In the second half we continued, but I knew we needed something special to score the first goal. If we scored the first goal I was sure we would win."  Stoke City manager Tony Pulis:  "We were second best from the first whistle to the last. Swansea were better and deserved to win. I've got no excuses. "You have good and bad days in football and this was a bad day for us. We looked a yard short all over the pitch. We looked sluggish and sloppy. "Whether it's the fact we played [Crystal] Palace in extra-time [in the FA Cup] and had to travel down early and had not been able to do anything for two days because of the snow, I don't know. But it wasn't us today."

23.04.2013 09:50:58 Loic Remy scored on his Queens Park Rangers debut but Joe Cole's second-half strike denied Harry Redknapp a victory at former club West Ham. The ??8m striker had put the Premier League's bottom club ahead 13 minutes into his first appearance, firing home after Adel Taarabt's pin-point pass. But West Ham dominated a breathless second half, levelling through Cole's close-range strike and going close on countless other occasions. QPR held on for a draw but stay bottom. Nevertheless, a point at one his old clubs was another encouraging result for Redknapp's side, who remain unbeaten in 2013. Having kept back-to-back Premier League clean sheets against Chelsea and Tottenham there was more evidence here of a defensive solidity absent in the early months of the season. West Ham went close through Mohamed Diame and Kevin Nolan in the early moments and were denied a penalty by referee Howard Webb when Marouane Chamakh stumbled under the challenge of Clint Hill and went down after a tangle of legs with Shaun Wright-Phillips. But it was clear the arrival of Remy from Marseilles had added to the renewed optimism at QPR. When the Frenchman raced onto Taarabt's beautifully judged through-ball to give the visitors the lead, their burgeoning self-belief was plain to see and Redknapp's side looked an altogether more potent threat as half-time approached. The second half was a very different story, however. West Ham tackled, denied space and dominated territory and their uncomplicated, direct approach forced QPR onto the back foot. Les Ferdinand was among the scorers the last time QPR won at Upton Park in August 1993, the first month of the Premier League season, as the snow began to fall, the hosts battled to preserve their impressive record against Rangers. First, Chamakh's close-range header was turned away by visiting keeper Julio Cesar, and Diame's follow-up shot was blocked by Hill before Kevin Nolan headed narrowly over. Matt Jarvis created another opportunity for Chamakh soon after but the Moroccan's towering header was well saved by Cesar. Hammers substitute Carlton Cole then forced the keeper into another tremendous save, but the Brazilian was unable to hold the striker's header and Joe Cole turned the loose ball into the net from two yards for the first goal of his second spell at West Ham. As West Ham sensed a winner, Winston Reid's fierce goal-bound shot was blocked bravely by Stephane Mbia after a goalmouth scramble, before Joe Cole rounded Cesar only to see his shot turned away by Hill as Rangers held on.  West Ham manager Sam Allardyce: "We couldn't have created more opportunities to score more goals. We're looking very dejected almost like we've lost in the dressing room, because we knew that performance should've got three points. I said to the lads, 'look, carry on like that and you'll win more games than you'll draw'. "At the other end all we've got done by is the sucker punch, which we talked about before the game. It's an encouraging performance to do what we did today, but the frustration and disappointment was it didn't lead to what should've been a comfortable victory."  QPR boss Harry Redknapp: "I couldn't fault the effort but we have to keep the ball and play a bit. If we could have got the ball after scoring I felt the fans would have turned on them. But they were teeing off and dropping balls up to front men. "The players have been excellent we have been on a good little run. We just want to keep that going and keep improving. We are still there [bottom of the table] but we are in much better shape that we were six or seven weeks ago. There will be teams looking over their shoulder."

23.04.2013 09:50:58 Steven Fletcher scored twice as Sunderland came from behind to win a five-goal thriller and send Wigan Athletic into the bottom three. David Vaughan's own goal gave the Latics the lead when he diverted Ronnie Stam's shot into the net. Craig Gardner levelled with a penalty after James McCarthy handled, and Fletcher made it 2-1 from close range. Fletcher found the top corner with an excellent strike, with Angelo Henriquez heading a consolation for Wigan. Eighteen-year-old Henriquez, on loan from Manchester United, set up a grandstand finish at the DW Stadium. But Wigan were once again undone by Fletcher, who has now scored six goals in seven Premier League games against them. While Sunderland's recent problems appear behind them, Roberto Martinez's side are in trouble after another failure in front of their own fans. The Spaniard has seen his side win one of the last 10 Premier League games and their poor home form is a cause of real concern. This was the fifth straight top-flight game they have failed to win at the DW Stadium. In addition, Wigan are the only Premier League club yet to keep a clean sheet at home this season. They have been hurt by injuries to key defenders and the imminent return of Antolin Alcaraz cannot come soon enough. But it may require more than the Paraguay international to fix Wigan's problems. Martinez's men were gifted a fourth-minute lead when Stam's mis-hit shot - following an exquisite pass by Gomez that allowed Jean Beausejour to whip in a low cross - struck Vaughan and flew into the net. But two goals in the space of three minutes turned an entertaining match upside down. The visitors equalised when Gardner sent Ali Al Habsi the wrong way from the spot in the 17th minute - Sunderland's first penalty in 34 matches - after James McCarthy, on his 100th Premier League appearance, handled Sebastian Larsson's free-kick. Backed by 4,800 travelling supporters, the Black Cats were clearly starting to feel at home and they went ahead when Fletcher struck again from close range. Al Habsi kept out the Scot's 20th-minute close-range header from a cross by the lively Alfred N'Diaye - making his first top-flight start - but the striker followed up to score. While Sunderland were commanding and confident, Wigan stuttered. They fell further behind before half-time when ??12m signing Fletcher found the top corner after collecting a pass from Adam Johnson on the edge of the area. The hosts rallied after the interval, Shaun Maloney twice going close along with Maynor Figueroa. Substitute Henriquez did find the net when the Chilean headed home Maloney's cross but the damage had been done and Sunderland celebrated a fourth win in six league games.  Wigan boss Roberto Martinez on his team's top-flight status: "We never take anything for granted. "If we had done that we would never have had eight seasons at this level. Today we weren't good enough defensively for 30 minutes. We need to rectify that. "Ivan Ramis' injury last week cost us today's points. That is something I need to correct."  Sunderland boss Martin O'Neill: "Fletcher was fantastic. It was not just his goals but also his whole centre forward play. "We took great heart from his performance. We've had to show a lot of fight and determination. "Wigan threw a lot at us but and were never out of it. It was all hands to the pump at the end and I am delighted with the result."

23.04.2013 09:50:58 Chelsea's poor home record under Rafael Benitez continued as Southampton fought back from 2-0 down to snatch a point. Demba Ba leapt to put the Blues ahead with a deflected shot and Eden Hazard added a second before the break, following up when Ramires hit the bar. Saints created little until Rickie Lambert came off the bench to head home Nathaniel Clyne's cross. Jason Puncheon levelled when he smashed home Luke Shaw's cross and Southampton left with an unlikely draw. Chelsea have now won only one out of six domestic games at Stamford Bridge under Benitez and, for the third successive home game, boos rang out at the final whistle. It was easy to understand the home fans' frustrations. This was a game that they seemingly had wrapped up at half-time despite missing several chances but they were rattled by Lambert's introduction and instant impact. Ba could have made sure of the points when he volleyed over in the second half but sloppy defending gave Puncheon room for his explosive finish, which leaves Chelsea 13 points behind leaders Manchester United, with 16 games left. It was only the third time in 90 home matches in the Premier League era that Chelsea had surrendered a 2-0 half-time lead, a slip particularly ill-timed from Benitez's point of view considering the news about Pep Guardiola earlier in the day. The announcement that the long-term Chelsea managerial target is to take charge of Bayern Munich next summer might have been bad news for Blues owner Roman Abramovich, but surely represents a window of opportunity for his interim boss. If Benitez is to stay for longer than the end of this campaign, then results will arguably matter more than the opinion of the fans who have opposed his appointment from the start. At the moment, both are going against him on home turf. Benitez has claimed this is down to the tactics of visiting teams rather than a reaction to the often abusive atmosphere but against Southampton it was poor finishing - and defending - that was to blame. Chelsea were comfortable at the break, taking the lead through Ba's instinctive finish from Cesar Azpilicueta's cross and doubling it when Hazard impressively despatched a bouncing ball from the edge of the area after Ramires had struck the bar. But the home side were given a rude awakening when Saints' top scorer Lambert, left on the bench while his side looked to defend deep and counter-attack before half-time, was summoned for a rescue mission. It took Lambert, the leading English scorer in the top division, precisely two minutes and 47 seconds to announce his arrival in the game, powering home his header for his 10th goal of a productive campaign. Chelsea could still have made the points safe, with Ba missing the target completely after he ran on to Juan Mata's superbly clipped pass, but it was Saints who had the last word as they extended their unbeaten league run to five games. Shaw raided forward down the left flank and his cross was allowed to bounce across the edge of the area, where it was met by Puncheon to take a touch and fire a superb strike past the helpless Cech.  Chelsea interim manager Rafael Benitez: "We should have won. "We didn't take our chances when we had them. We had situations where we could score. We didn't and they broke on a counter-attack. We gave them hope they could score and they did it. "I was talking to the team at half-time, trying to say 'we have to score a third goal'. "I think for us we cannot be happy drawing at home. I am disappointed.  Southampton manager Nigel Adkins: "We came with a game-plan to be compact and frustrate the opposition. "It was a big call to leave Rickie Lambert out but we wanted to make sure we were in the game. "At half-time it was 2-0 and I said, 'stick to the game-plan'. If we had gone and chased it there was every chance we could have ended up with a scoreline like Aston Villa, who conceded eight here. "We stuck at it. Rickie came on and scored the goal and what a fantastic goal it was for the second one.

23.04.2013 09:50:58 Manchester City clinched an eventful win at Arsenal to keep up the pressure on leaders Manchester United. The Gunners had Laurent Koscielny sent off after 10 minutes for hauling down Edin Dzeko in the box, but Dzeko saw the resulting penalty saved. City poured forward and James Milner put them ahead with an angled finish. Dzeko made it 2-0 from close range but Arsenal dug in after half-time and Vincent Kompany's late red card meant both sides finished with 10 men. Kompany will feel the decision, for what referee Mike Dean adjudged to be a reckless tackle on Jack Wilshere, was harsh but it gave the Gunners hope in the last 15 minutes. Even then, the home side struggled to create chances, and their first serious shot on target came in the 90th minute when Theo Walcott beat Joe Hart but saw Joleon Lescott clear off the line. City's win did not end up being as resounding as it had threatened to be, but it was still a crucial result in the title race.  Manchester United's victory over Liverpool earlier on Sunday had increased their advantage at the top of the table to 10 points, piling the pressure on City to respond with a positive result. The defending champions' appalling record at Arsenal - they had not beaten the Gunners at the Emirates Stadium or Highbury in the league for more than 37 years - did not offer Roberto Mancini's men much encouragement of managing that before kick-off. But Koscielny's 10th-minute sending off, after he had wrestled Dzeko to the ground inside the area by wrapping two arms around the Bosnian striker to prevent him running on to a Gareth Barry header, handed City the perfect platform to change that awful statistic, and keep their neighbours in sight. Dzeko made a hash of the resulting penalty, firing it straight at Wojciech Szczesny's legs and seeing the Gunners keeper grab the ball after it rolled back towards him along the goalline. It did not take City long to make their extra man count, however. Arsenal switched off at a free-kick, which Barry took quickly, and Carlos Tevez slid Milner clear to beat Szczesny with a powerful angled finish. More chances followed, with Javi Garcia heading the best of them wide. Arsenal could do little but try to halt the relentless pressure, but they conceded a second goal after 32 minutes. Again, more could have been done more to prevent it. Milner fired in a dangerous cross after Pablo Zabaleta got the better of Kieran Gibbs down the right and, although Szczesny kept out Tevez's initial effort, Dzeko was on hand to tap home the rebound. Only a Wilshere header off the line stopped Garcia heading home a third before half-time and, at the interval, City might have been thinking of how they could give their goal-difference a boost. Instead, Arsenal showed commendable spirit to stop the flood of City attacks, even if they rarely threatened at the other end. Szczesny did well to dive at the feet of Tevez when he ran clear but, aside from an Olivier Giroud header that flew over Hart's bar, that was the most meaningful incident of any kind until Kompany saw red. City's captain got the ball when he slid in on Wilshere and protested his innocence to referee Dean, but the official made it clear he felt it was a dangerous challenge. With parity restored in terms of men on the field, the home fans tried to roar their side forward. But the closest Arsenal came to a reply was when substitute Lescott denied Walcott, leaving Arsene Wenger's men six points adrift of a top-four spot, albeit with a game in hand on fourth-placed Tottenham.  Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger: " "It was frustrating [to go down to 10 men] but we got away with it [with the penalty miss]. "We were down to 10 men with 80 minutes to go and knew it would be a difficult game. "We gave away two cheap goals, at 10 men you keep it 0-0 and you never know. "But we were too timid and did not have enough authority on the game. We let them dictate the game to us and when we went 1-0 down it was difficult."  Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini: "If you play with 10 players it is very difficult [like Arsenal had to do for most of the game]. "But, we started with a good attitude and pressed high as we wanted to win the game, it was easier after the sending off. Second half we were too soft and I thought the game could re-open. "It was an important victory. We knew it was difficult to play here [at Emirates Stadium]."

23.04.2013 09:50:58 Manchester United kept a firm grip on the Premier League title race with a deserved victory against Liverpool at Old Trafford. The meeting had been billed as the battle of the strikers between Manchester United's Robin van Persie and Liverpool counterpart Luis Suarez. And it was Van Persie who made the decisive contribution as he put United ahead with a brilliant first-half finish then provided the free-kick for the second after 54 minutes as Patrice Evra's header deflected in off Nemanja Vidic. Liverpool's ??12m signing from Chelsea Daniel Sturridge scored for the second successive game after coming on as substitute to give Brendan Rodgers's side hope and set up an anxious finish for United. Sturridge missed a glorious chance to give Liverpool a point that their inferiority for the first hour barely deserved, but United closed out the win to go 10 points clear at the top of the table ahead of Manchester City's visit to Arsenal. The scale of Van Persie's influence since his ??24m summer arrival from Arsenal can be illustrated by the fact that this was his 10th goal in 10 games - and he has scored in nine of them. United were eventually relieved to get the three points after outplaying Liverpool for long periods, only to fail to convert a succession of chances in the opening 45 minutes. One could only imagine manager Sir Alex Ferguson's reaction had they squandered their advantage. Liverpool can take a measure of consolation from a lively closing phase, but the 24-point gap between themselves and the club they regard as fierce rivals makes painful reading. They were too passive and negative until United had a two-goal lead, with ??15m summer signing Joe Allen looking out of his depth in midfield before he was taken off. Rodgers decided to keep Sturridge on the bench - leaving Suarez with virtually a watching brief in a first half controlled by Manchester United. Netherlands striker Van Persie demonstrated his world class quality to put United ahead after 19 minutes. United opened up Liverpool with controlled possession and Van Persie reacted quicker than Daniel Agger to clip an instant finish past keeper Pepe Reina from Evra's cross. Danny Welbeck was a somewhat surprising selection alongside Van Persie but more than justified his inclusion with an energetic display. He was off target with one effort and then it took a brilliant tackle from Agger to halt the striker after Allen gifted United possession. Allen was fortunate again when his poor defensive header fell to Tom Cleverley, whose crisp volley flew inches wide with Reina beaten. As Liverpool struggled to stay in the game, they had their biggest escape on the stroke of half-time as both Van Persie and Shinji Kagawa failed to turn in Rafael's cross, Reina needing lengthy treatment after being injured in the scramble. Both sides made changes at the interval. Antonio Valencia replaced Ashley Young, who had been injured in a collision with Agger, while Liverpool sent on the more attack-minded Sturridge for Lucas Leiva. It was United who extended their lead nine minutes after the break when poor marking allowed Evra to steal in on Van Persie's free-kick, his header brushing off Vidic to beat Reina. Liverpool, outplayed for so long, needed an instant response and got one as Sturridge was first to react as United keeper David de Gea could only push out Steven Gerrard's shot. At last the battle had been joined, but it still needed Reina to show great athleticism to save from Shinji Kagawa's precise 20-yard effort. Remarkably given their first half domination, United spent the closing minutes hanging on and Sturridge wasted a great chance to give Liverpool an unlikely point after Suarez wriggled his way into the area.

23.04.2013 09:50:58 Aston Villa slipped into the bottom three in controversial circumstances as Jay Rodriguez's blatant first-half dive helped Southampton to a valuable win.  Top scorer Rickie Lambert swept home from the penalty spot after the ??7m summer signing went down without contact from Enda Stevens in the area. Villa rallied after the break and went closest to an equaliser when Nathan Baker headed onto the crossbar. The result saw the Saints leapfrog Villa and move clear of the drop zone. The winter months have not been kind to Villa's inexperienced side, and the embarrassing midweek League Cup semi-final first-leg defeat to Bradford was their fourth in seven games in all competitions. While Villa's slide down the Premier League table had seen them take only 10 points from their last 11 fixtures, Nigel Adkins's ever-improving Southampton outfit came to Villa Park on the back of only two losses in 10 league games. Despite the disparity in recent form, Villa started the brighter and forced a number of corners as giant centre-forward Christian Benteke repeatedly pressured the slight figure of visiting right-back Nathaniel Clyne. Villa's problems have been exacerbated by a long dry spell in front of goal - they had only scored seven times in their last 10 league matches - and again they were unable to turn momentum into chances. Southampton's superior confidence on the ball then started to show and Rodriguez should have done better after he was smartly played into space on the right wing by Lambert but his control at pace let him down in the area and he could only scuff a weak pass into goalkeeper Brad Guzman's arms. Referee Mark Halsey had earlier angered the Southampton bench by failing to punish a high challenge from Stevens on Gaston Ramirez and a flailing elbow from Benteke on Maya Yoshida, but the game's key officiating decision came in the 33rd minute when he pointed to the spot after Rodriguez tumbled in the area. While the furious Villa players raced to question Halsey's call, Rodriguez attempted to plead his innocence by mouthing: "I did not dive." Lambert, who joined joined Southampton for ??1m in 2009, then stepped up to send Guzan the wrong way and retain his perfect penalty record for the club. Villa manager Paul Lambert took off the ineffectual Brett Holman at half-time and switched to a 4-4-2 formation, and his decision led to a much improved performance. Benteke should have scored his 10th goal of the season after he picked up on goalkeeper Artur Boruc's dangerous parry from Stevens' 25-yard effort but the Belgium international could only side-foot his effort over the crossbar. The previously invisible Charles N'Zogbia then struck a firm low drive into the Pole's arms, though Southampton's dangerous attacking options came to the fore once again as the exciting Jason Puncheon struck the base of the post after cutting inside from the right. Villa continued to push for a vital leveller and again Benteke was the man at the centre of things. First, he smartly twisted into space on the edge of the area before firing a wild effort wide with his left foot , then a more measured curling effort with his favoured right went inches beyond the post. A desperate late rally went to no avail as Baker hit the woodwork for Villa before Benteke and substitute Jordan Bowery failed to find the target with close-range efforts. While Wigan's draw at Fulham pushed Villa into the bottom-three, Southampton's resilience was rewarded with a fifth win in six games against their fellow strugglers.

23.04.2013 09:50:59 Everton's hopes of qualifying for the Champions League suffered a setback as they were held to a goalless draw by Swansea City at Goodison Park. The Toffees carved out a string of chances against the Capital One Cup semi-finalists but failed to score for the first time in 19 league games. Michel Vorm denied Victor Anichebe, while the Swans keeper also frustrated Nikica Jelavic and Phil Neville. Swansea's best chance saw Tim Howard tip Michu's effort onto the bar. Spain's coach Vicente del Bosque was present to witness Michu go close to his 14th Premier League goal in his 21st appearance. But while the ??2m signing from Rayo Vallecano looks set to break into his national side next month, Everton have their work cut out if they are are secure a top-four finish. Despite keeping a first clean sheet in the league for four months, David Moyes' side paid the price for failing to take their chances on a frustrating afternoon for the hosts. Everton dominated Swansea in the last meeting between the teams in September and the Merseyside club once again bossed the opening exchanges with Jelavic having three chances in the opening 15 minutes alone. The Croatian international was denied by Vorm as early as the third minute, the Swansea keeper reacting well after his side had carelessly gifted possession just outside his penalty box. Vorm then raced outside his area to block a follow-up by Anichebe, before a mis-kick by Jelavic bounced narrowly wide after the former Rangers striker had connected with Pienaar's teasing delivery in the ninth minute. After Jelavic went close with a glancing header, Vorm again came to Swansea's rescue when the Dutch keeper took the sting out of Anichebe's goal-bound header which allowed Ashley Williams to clear off the line. It was all Everton but Michu delivered a sharp reminder that Swansea, fresh from their Capital One Cup heroics at Chelsea, were still very much in the game. In front of his national manager, the 26-year-old let fly from an acute angle, following a delightful ball from Nathan Dyer, which Tim Howard flicked onto his bar for what was the Everton keeper's only serious save of the first half. Everton had scored in the last 18 Premier League games yet they continued to squander chances after the interval. Phil Neville and Sylvain Distin both went close before Pablo Hernandez stung Howard's fingers in the closing stages. Swansea dug deep to stretch their unbeaten league run to five matches and will head for Wednesday's FA Cup third-round replay at Arsenal  in high spirits.  Everton manager David Moyes:  "We're a bit frustrated but Swansea did a really good job in midweek on Chelsea, not dissimilar (to this). "We needed to play a bit better, pass it a bit quicker and be a little bit cleverer in the final third. "We had three or four good opportunities, but just not perfect (ones). "Swansea have had a busy week, a hard week, and it is a great point for them. We're just disappointed we couldn't turn our opportunities into goals."  Swansea manager Michael Laudrup:  "It has been a little bit more than a good week - it has been a great week. "Three very difficult games, different games, and I think three great performances. "To come here and play Everton in such a difficult away game, after playing in midweek against Chelsea, and to get a point is a great result. "Once more, it was a great performance, although maybe getting the points in a different way that we are used to."

23.04.2013 09:50:59 Papiss Cisse scored a dramatic stoppage-time winner as Newcastle deservedly beat Fulham to move five points clear of the relegation zone. After hitting the post and missing a number of other chances, Cisse volleyed home with one of the game's last kicks. Mid-table Fulham went close in either half through Dimitar Berbatov, but they were under pressure for long periods. Vurnon Anita shot against the bar and Yoann Gouffran also hit the post before Cisse secured victory at the death. It was the third time Newcastle had scored a stoppage-time winner in their last four Premier League games at St James' Park. But more importantly for the Magpies, it eases relegation concerns that had intensified amid a run of three defeats in four games. Fulham looked to have survived Newcastle's bombardment to escape with a point, only for their efforts to be undermined at the last. While this brings to an end their three-match unbeaten run away from home, they remain in 10th place. Martin Jol's men made the better start and Berbatov almost scored for the fifth consecutive match with a curling strike. Newcastle's attempts to establish a rhythm was hampered when left-back David Santon limped off with a hamstring problem - Alan Pardew's latest in a long list of injury concerns. To the manager's credit, he stuck with the 4-4-2 formation that paired Cisse and Gouffran up front, and his side managed to build a degree of momentum as Fulham offered little going forward. Their best chances fell to Cisse, but the Senegal striker curled narrowly wide before blazing a shot over the bar. Newcastle's profligacy seemed to give Fulham confidence and, as the first half drew to a close, it took a fine Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa block to thwart Bryan Ruiz before Tim Krul denied Stanislav Manolev. The Magpies have conceded more second-half goals than any other Premier League side bar Aston Villa, but on this occasion they found themselves encamped inside opposition territory for long periods. Anita - Santon's replacement - set the tone with a drive that was deflected on to the bar by Fulham substitute Emmanuel Frimpong, while Cisse was let down by a poor touch in front of goal. They again went close when Sylvain Marveaux's corner was headed on to a post by Gouffran - it may have touched Sascha Riether arm on the way through - and Cisse hit the same upright with the follow-up. Newcastle still looked stunned by their failure to score when Fulham went up the other end and Berbatov drew a superb diving save from Krul with a header from John Arne Riise's free-kick. Jol introduced Hugo Rodallega and he almost made an immediate impact, only to lose his balance when seemingly clean through. Although Newcastle flooded forward towards the end, their hopes appeared to die when Mark Schwarzer kept out a Cisse header. However, the front man would have one last say, controlling Yohan Cabaye's shot and reacting quickest to drill past Krul.  Fulham manager Martin Jol:  "We defended well, especially in the first half. We frustrated the crowd and that's what you want away from home. We had two or three opportunities but didn't score. "It's not easy to come here and get away with a result but today we probably should have, at least one point. It's unbelievable they [Newcastle] are in that position and a draw would have been disappointing for them. "But if you've watched us over the last three months we've done ever so well, frustrated home teams and scored at the right moment. We didn't today and that's disappointing. Conceding late is even more disappointing. "We've had a very good run and we said today we don't want to break that - getting a result here was our intention. We're disappointed."

23.04.2013 09:50:59 Franco Di Santo's first Premier League goal in three months earned Wigan Athletic a deserved point at Fulham. The hosts had gone ahead through Giorgos Karagounis's 25-yard strike. Di Santo missed from close range after Emmerson Boyce's cross, before Shaun Maloney's deflected 25-yard effort was spectacularly tipped onto the bar. But Wigan equalised when Di Santo cut in from the left wing, ran unchallenged and fired past Mark Schwarzer to lift his side out of the bottom three. However, there was nearly late drama at Craven Cottage as Bryan Ruiz's shot was headed off the line by Maynor Figueroa to deny Fulham victory. Fulham have still only won four home league games this season but made a bright start as Mladen Petric wasted a free-kick from just outside the penalty area and then shot over with a wild effort from a similar distance. The game's first bit of class came from Ruiz, who delightfully chipped a pass over the Wigan defence, but Dimitar Berbatov could not collect the ball as Latics goalkeeper Ali Al Habsi gathered. Fulham went ahead in the 22nd minute when Karagounis, who also scored from long range against Blackpool in the FA Cup last week, grabbed another as his 25-yard strike went in off the post. The Greek midfielder's first Premier League goal meant Wigan have now gone behind in 15 of their 22 league matches this season. Of the previous 14 games in which they have conceded first, they had gone on to lose all but one of them. But at Craven Cottage they showed their resilience as they were the better side for the rest of the match. James McArthur's weak shot from 18 yards was straight at Schwarzer before Di Santo should have scored but wasted a chance from five yards. In the second half, Maloney's deflected 25-yard effort was tipped onto the bar by Schwarzer, who produced a stunning fingertip save to keep his side ahead as the Cottagers clung on. Kieran Richardson produced an excellent piece of defending when he slid in to deny Di Santo in the penalty area after a storming run forward from James McCarthy, before Maloney shot at the Fulham goalkeeper. Di Santo, with an exquisite piece of skill, then flicked the ball up and volleyed on the turn but his shot went narrowly wide. However, Wigan grabbed the goal their play deserved when a quickly taken free-kick allowed Di Santo to cut in from the left-wing, run unchallenged to the edge of the penalty area and blast the ball past Schwarzer for his first Premier League goal since 6 October. Di Santo had a chance to claim all three points when he again ran at the Fulham defence, created some space and fired a low shot from 12 yards which Schwarzer did well to push wide. Then, down at the other end, Ruiz's shot was headed off the line by Figueroa. The point gained takes Wigan out of the bottom three and above Aston Villa into 17th, while Fulham remain 13th, six points above the relegation zone.  Fulham boss Martin Jol said: "If you are 1-0 up you have to score a second goal and we were very sloppy. We lost the ball and kept them in the game. We've had two disappointing results but we have to take it. "I wouldn't say we're in a relegation battle but we need the points. "We don't have all of the millions to spend but you have to be creative. Sometimes you could do with one of two quality players and hopefully we will do something."  Wigan manager Roberto Martinez said: "It's a decent point overall but I'm sure we had most of the threat and, with the amount of opportunities we had, I'm disappointed we could only get one goal. "It's a tough place to come once you give them a goal lead. Every time we went forward we carried a real goal threat and Mark Schwarzer's save from Shaun Maloney is the save of the weekend and probably the save of the season."  On Ivan Ramis's injury [the defender was carried off on a stretcher late on], Martinez added: "I thought he was outstanding from the first minute until he had to come off. "We fear he has damaged his ligaments in his right knee. We will have to see the scan but I fear the worst."

23.04.2013 09:50:59 An uninspiring affair at Carrow Road ended in a goalless draw between Norwich and Newcastle. Gabriel Obertan had a well-struck shot smartly saved by Canaries' keeper Mark Bunn but chances were in short supply. Norwich defender Russell Martin went close in the second half, only to see his long-range shot hit the post. Anthony Pilkington had a late chance for the home side but, after cutting inside, his 15-yard shot was saved by keeper Tim Krul. While those at Carrow Road may not have found much solace from the match, the draw checked a run of defeats suffered by both camps. Norwich had lost their last four league games and Newcastle, who are only two points above the relegation zone, earned their first point in four games. The Magpies, however, remain without an away win this season and never looked like changing that statistic against former manager Chris Hughton's Norwich side. Newcastle centre-back Fabricio Coloccini, who has asked to leave the club to return to his native Argentina, did start for Alan Pardew's side, along with the club's new signing, right-back Mathieu Debuchy, and the visitors almost caught their hosts cold from the kick-off. Canaries' centre-back Sebastien Bassong let a long ball go, only for Obertan to steal in behind him and deliver a low cross for striker Papiss Cisse which was intercepted by keeper Mark Bunn. Obertan also had a 25-yard effort saved by Bunn but that was a rare moment of excitement in a disappointing match. Both sides lacked any bite to their attack, with Cisse struggling to fill the void left by Demba Ba, who has joined Chelsea.  The home side's struggles were epitomised when they failed to make the most of a counter-attack which pitted three of their players against two back-tracking Newcastle defenders. The move ended with Simeon Jackson pulling the ball back for Wes Hoolahan, who took a touch instead of shooting first time and let Magpies midfielder James Perch run back to get in a vital tackle. Norwich hinted there might be an improvement immediately after the break when a lovely move ended with Hoolahan's cross for the in-rushing Bradley Johnson being cleared by Obertan. There was more urgency from the home side in the second half, although Newcastle's dogged defending restricted any clear-cut chances. The Magpies brought on key midfielder Yohan Cabaye for his first appearance for them since 11 November, while Norwich striker Grant Holt's 67th-minute introduction signalled his return from a hamstring problem.  Neither could help break the deadlock, although Pilkington did threaten a goal when he cut inside before having his shot saved by Krul. Pilkington also went close in the final moments of the match but could not divert Holt's header across goal into the net.  Norwich manager Chris Hughton:  "Our final ball and our delivery from set plays let us down. "On the balance of play we were the better team but you have to score goals and we weren't able to do that. "Certainly, in the end it was not a bad point."  Newcastle boss Alan Pardew:  "I don't want to comment too much [about Coloccini]. It's club business and we will talk to him this week."  On the match:  "It was a more favourable result for us than for Norwich as they were the home side. It was two teams that worked hard and restricted the opposition. "For us it was important to get a clean sheet. We worked hard in the week and it showed. "I had the luxury of putting some senior players on the pitch and the result showed that. That was a key game. We have Reading at home and Aston Villa away coming up so it is an important time for us. "Hopefully, we will bring in a couple [of new signings] because we need to be a lot stronger."

23.04.2013 09:50:59 Three goals in the final eight minutes gave Reading an unlikely win over West Brom at the Madejski Stadium. Romelu Lukaku had scored either side of half-time to give the dominant Baggies a deserved lead. But Jimmy Kebe pulled one back before Adam Le Fondre's penalty drew the home side level with two minutes to go. Pavel Pogrebnyak dived in from close range to put Reading ahead on 90 minutes and they hung on for only their third win of the season. The dramatic finale keeps Reading in 19th position, two points clear of QPR at the foot of the Premier League table, while West Brom will wonder how they failed to earn anything from a game they controlled until the final stages. Royals manager Brian McDermott handed a debut to Portuguese midfielder Daniel Carrico, who signed from Sporting Lisbon at the start of January. A run of two wins in the last eight games had seen West Brom slip back from a high point of third in the table, but despite the recent wobble in form, the Baggies were already 11 points better off than at the same stage last season. The home side started brightly and ensured much of the opening phase was played in West Brom's half, but despite a series of corners West Brom's defence prevented goalkeeper Ben Foster from seeing much of the ball. But it was Foster's opposite number, Adam Federici, who made the game's first save of note after a quarter of an hour, palming away a shot that James Morrison had hit on the half-volley from the edge of the box. The chance was a warning note from the visitors, who took the lead a minute later when Morrison turned provider. The Scot combined with Lukaku to peel away to the left before placing a low cross that the on-loan Chelsea striker converted from inside the six-yard box for his eighth goal of the season. Reading responded with urgency, but without enough guile or craft to threaten Foster. Jimmy Kebe's poor first touch to a long clearance allowed the West Brom defence to recover. Carrico's debut came to abrupt end at half-time when McDermott replaced him with Garath McCleary, but the change made little difference to the confident visitors, and especially Lukaku. The Belgian striker saw a last-ditch block from Adrian Mariappa stop him from hitting the target, and he had the ball in the net a minute later when he stretched to poke the ball home, only to be flagged for offside. Lukaku hit the post and the bar before finally getting his second, racing on to a clearance from defence to shoot low past Federici's left hand to put West Brom within reach of all three points. But Reading transformed in the latter stages to grab a much-needed win. Kebe stooped low to head home McCleary's cross, and it was Kebe who was clumsily fouled by Jonas Olsson to give substitute Le Fondre the chance to equalise from 12 yards. Spurred on by a raucous home crowd, Reading sealed their comeback in the final minute of normal time when Pogrebnyak bundled in a knock-down from Alex Pearce past Foster. Just a few minutes earlier Reading had been set to slip to the foot of the table, but the turnaround now puts them three points short of Aston Villa in the relegation zone.  Reading manager Brian McDermott said: "I'm looking forward to watching the last eight minutes of that game! It just sums up the atmosphere around the Madejski Stadium, the crowd really got us back into the game. Once Jimmy scored, they were fantastic. "That was a big three points today, I thought the character and resilience of our players was excellent. "We were a little bit flat in the first half, they hit the bar and the post, but we stayed in the game and showed quality when we needed to."  West Brom manager Steve Clarke said: "We went from complete control of the game to somehow losing a game we should have won comfortably. "I'm a little bit shell-shocked. For 81 minutes we had so much control of the game, we created chances, hit the crossbar and post, and scored two good goals. "We were so far in front you could not see the end to the game coming. But football can sometimes be a strange game."

23.04.2013 09:50:59 Jon Walters scored two own goals and missed a penalty as Chelsea thumped Stoke to end the Potters' 17-game home unbeaten run in the Premier League. Walters headed a Cesar Azpilicueta cross into his own net just before half-time and repeated his unwanted trick from a Juan Mata corner. Frank Lampard made it 3-0 from the spot after Mata was fouled and Eden Hazard smashed in a fourth from 30 yards out. Walters' misery was completed when he blasted a late penalty against the bar. The 29-year-old Republic of Ireland international has won plenty of plaudits for his play for the Potters this season but his 100th Premier League appearance turned into a memorable day for all the wrong reasons. Chelsea move third in the table with what became a runaway victory but they were under the cosh for long spells early on and were grateful to assistant referee Sian Massey for correctly reversing a decision to award Stoke a penalty with the score at 1-0. Referee Andre Marriner pointed to the spot when Azpilicueta slid in to bring down Matthew Etherington inside the area, but Massey had already flagged Etherington offside. Stoke, who have never beaten Chelsea at the Britannia Stadium, had begun the game brightly, bombarding the visitors with balls into the box and seeing Kenwyne Jones fire narrowly wide. Demba Ba was making his Premier League debut for Chelsea but, in the early stages, he was busier in his own area and twice had to hack clear. Ba, preferred to Fernando Torres up front, got more involved at the other end of the pitch as the half progressed. He provided the flick for Lampard to burst into the area and bring a reflex save from Asmir Begovic, then ran clear himself to force another fine stop. Then came Walters first faux pas, which saw him send a bullet header past Begovic as he tried to beat Mata to a cross. His second own goal came moments after Massey had denied Stoke a penalty. This time Walters beat Lampard to Mata's delivery and saw the ball bounce in. Lampard's powerful spot-kick, from a penalty awarded when Robert Huth pushed Mata, left the home side with no way back. Stoke's first home defeat in the league since February last year, and their heaviest at the Britannia Stadium since they returned to the top flight in 2008, was confirmed when Hazard span into space 30 yards from goal and unleashed an unstoppable shot into the top corner. There was more good news for Chelsea when John Terry came off the bench with 10 minutes left for his first appearance in two months, but there was to be no happy ending for Walters. He was fouled by Terry inside the area with only seconds to go and stepped up to take the spot-kick himself, only to slam it against the bar.

23.04.2013 09:50:59 Impressive Sunderland brushed aside woeful West Ham with an emphatic win to ease relegation fears on Wearside. Sebastian Larsson's 25-yard thunderbolt lit up a dour first half, before Adam Johnson pounced after a Dan Potts error to double the lead from close range. Jack Colback hit the woodwork as West Ham began to crumble, before James McClean finished from a tight angle. The visitors failed to threaten until the end, when Ricardo Vaz Te and James Tomkins were denied by Simon Mignolet. The 3-0 scoreline was no less than Sunderland deserved for taking full advantage of an abject display by the visitors. Larsson's sublime opener was the only real moment of quality in the first half, but after the break the Black Cats tormented their opponents with some slick counter-attacking football. Sunderland now sit one point behind the Hammers as both sides' seasons take on a distinctly mid-table feel. On this evidence, Sam Allardyce's side should be the more concerned about the possibility of being dragged into a relegation battle, but they could do nothing about Larsson's spectacular 12th-minute strike. When Alou Diarra's headed clearance fell to the Swede, he took two touches before slamming a swerving left-footed drive past the helpless Jussi Jaaskelainen for his first goal of the season. Sunderland were content to keep 10 men behind the ball after taking the lead, and West Ham lacked the guile to break them down, with the absence of injured midfielder Mark Noble keenly felt. West Ham then contributed to their own downfall for the crucial second goal: a Premier League debut moment to forget for their 18-year-old defender Dan Potts. After Jaaskelainen did superbly to save McClean's strike, Potts dallied on the rebound and the ball fell for Johnson to finish clinically from five yards. The visitors were then lucky to not concede again when Colback smashed an effort against the woodwork following some sloppy defending. Allardyce's side failed to muster even a corner until the 62nd minute, and they fell further behind to a strike with a touch of comedy about it. The impressive Stephane Sessegnon raced into the box but completely miscued his shot, which fell fortuitously into the path of McClean to tuck away from an acute angle. West Ham introduced loan signing Marouane Chamakh and finally began to create chances in the closing stages. Vaz Te and Tomkins forced fine stops from Mignolet, but the Hammers could not add to their paltry tally of five away goals for the season - the lowest in the Premier League.  Sunderland manager Martin O'Neill : "The win was important for us. I think anybody in the bottom half of the table still has to be looking anxiously over their shoulder. "We were brilliant from start to finish. We were energised after having a couple days off after the Bolton game. "We put West Ham on the back foot from the beginning, and a great goal from Seb (Larsson) settled us down." "I think it's our fourth win in seven games in the Premier League and in the context of things, it was good to win."  West Ham manager Sam Allardyce: "We didn't have the appetite for defending correctly and we never passed the ball as well as we know we can. "(The second goal) was pathetic, wasn't it? We have a free-kick and we let the opposition score. "The level of difference in performance between this game and last week against Manchester United is just staggering. "There are too many of my defenders injured; George McCartney, Joey O'Brien and today James Collins. I am really going to have to go and try to strengthen that area in the next few days."

23.04.2013 09:50:59 QPR put in a tenacious display as they earned manager Harry Redknapp a draw against his former club, Tottenham. R's keeper Julio Cesar tipped a Jermain Defoe shot onto the post and saved Emmanuel Adebayor's follow-up early on. But that was a rare scare for a resolute home side, who went close when Shaun Wright-Phillips had a shot deflected wide by Michael Dawson. Defoe also had a second-half shot saved by the leg of Cesar but the visitors could not break down their rivals. The match was Redknapp's first against Spurs since he was sacked by the White Hart Lane outfit last summer.  Having insisted that he bore no animosity either to his former employers or to his successor Andre Villas-Boas, Redknapp might have a slight smile of satisfaction as his relegation-battling side ended Tottenham's run of four successive wins. The visitors' record of having scored in every away game in the top flight so far this season was also ended as they failed to show the guile and creativity to break down the Hoops, who again showed signs of improvement to suggest they can avoid the drop. QPR had registered a shock win over Chelsea in their last league outing and the Loftus Road side continued to show the hard-working attitude and resilience that victory was built on to frustrate Spurs. Employing a 4-5-1 formation with playmaker Adel Taarabt playing as a striker, the home side shut down the time and space the visitors had on the ball with admirable determination and discipline. When QPR were almost breached, keeper Cesar came to their rescue with a top-class double save. The Brazilian tipped a 22-yard Defoe shot against the post and, after Adebayor latched on to the rebound, sidestepped defender Clint Hill and got in a low shot from 12 yards, Cesar got a hand to the strike to send it over. That was as close as Tottenham got to a goal as they struggled to make their superior quality count against the home side's work-rate. QPR's defensive solidity came at the cost of tempering them offensively, although a rare foray forward from them did almost stun Spurs. Taarabt stabbed a piercing pass through the Spurs defence into the run of Wright-Phillips, who cut inside before his effort was deflected wide by lunging centre-back Michael Dawson. The home side were impressively nullifying the threat of Spurs wingers Gareth Bale and Aaron Lennon and, while the entire QPR side were playing their part, Stephane Mbia and Jamie Mackie deserve honorary mentions. Midfielder Mbia's strong presence and Mackie's tigerish play set the tone for their side. Still Tottenham dominated possession but could not capitalise, with fleeting chances seeing Kyle Walker send a free-kick just high and Cesar again rescuing his side when he saved a Defoe shot with his leg. QPR's best hope of a goal was to catch Tottenham off-guard and they almost did so when Taarabt played a pass through to Wright-Phillips, who was thwarted by Spurs keeper Hugo Lloris rushing out of his goal to clear. Wright-Phillips nearly created a late chance for himself when he surged at the Spurs defence only to stumble as the match ended in stalemate.  QPR manager Harry Redknapp:  "That was very bit as good as the performance against Chelsea (a 1-0 win) - we worked our socks off against a real top team today. I can't ask for more than that. "We restricted to them very few opportunities. Nedum Onouha and Fabio nullified two fantastic wingers That was the quietest I've seen Gareth Bale for many a year."  With regard to the transfer window, Redknapp added:  "You hope you can get a couple of players in but if you don't we keep going with what we have. "If we can get the right players I'll bring them in, I won't bring them in for the sake of it."  Spurs manager Andre Villas-Boas:  "They defended very well; we wanted to play with a higher tempo, but they frustrate you. "Julio Cesar had a great game. We had some big chances; in a game like this it's important to score first. "It was a difficult game for us, but we got an away point so we are satisfied."  When asked about Redknapp Villas-Boas said:  "I have tried to be respectful and I think Harry is the same. He's been a great example to follow so there are no hard feelings."

23.04.2013 09:50:59 Substitute Victor Anichebe scored within 90 seconds of coming on to give Everton victory at Newcastle. The hosts took the lead in the second minute of the game when Papiss Cisse capitalised on a Toffees defensive error to head home. James Perch hit a post for the home side but Leighton Baines levelled with a stunning free-kick. Anichebe, introduced just before the hour, converted Nikica Jelavic's cross from close range shortly afterwards. Transfer target Demba Ba was withdrawn from the Newcastle squad earlier in the day when Chelsea triggered a release clause in the striker's contract, but barely one minute was showing on the clock when the hosts took the lead. Goalkeeper Tim Krul's free-kick floated towards the Everton defence and when Sylvain Distin and Johnny Heitinga collided, Cisse took the chance to nod the ball past Tim Howard. Krul denied Baines with two good saves within seconds of each other, firstly to touch away a long-range free-kick and then bravely at the left-back's feet as he tried to scramble the ball in ahead of Jelavic. Marouane Fellaini looked refreshed in his first match since completing a three-match suspension, and the Belgian saw a half-chance blocked by a well-timed tackle from Davide Santon but Newcastle went closer to scoring when James Perch headed against the post. But Everton equalised in spectacular fashion two minutes before half-time, Baines driving in a free kick from 30 yards that swerved past Krul's right hand after flying wide of the Newcastle wall. Shola Ameobi, included after Ba was withdrawn from the squad, was inches away from retaking the lead for Newcastle five minutes into the second half, the striker doing well to bring down a chip from Vurnon Anita before seeing his shot roll just wide of Howard's left-hand post. Manager David Moyes replaced Steven Naismith with Anichebe, and his decision quickly paid off in style as a move involving Steven Pienaar, Fellaini and Jelavic down Everton's left flank was smartly finished off by Anichebe from close range when he poked the ball home between Krul's legs. Cisse was then thwarted twice in quick succession, Heitinga blocking a header before the Senegal international flicked the rebound at Howard while falling to the ground. But Everton hung on for a win that lifts them to fifth place in the Premier League table, while Newcastle are two points above the relegation zone following their ninth defeat in 11 games.  Newcastle manager Alan Pardew: "We had a great start, I thought it was pretty even for long periods. They have a lot more experience and quality on the pitch than perhaps we did tonight. "We had big players missing, but our effort was outstanding and I can't fault them for that, they gave everything. "If we can get a bit more quality back in the team and maybe one or two in, which is probably important now, we'll be OK."  Everton manager David Moyes: "The first goal was a brilliantly struck free-kick, the second was a brilliantly worked move with good passing and good interchange of play. "I thought we played well, especially in the first half, I thought the second half got a bit harder but I was really pleased with the goals "I'm pleased that we have finished this Christmas-New Year period with a decent amount of points."

23.04.2013 09:50:59 QPR snatched a stunning win over Chelsea at Stamford Bridge through a late Shaun Wright-Phillips strike. The Premier League's bottom side shocked their in-form hosts when Wright-Phillips smashed home from the edge of the area after a corner. Chelsea, chasing a fifth straight win, dominated throughout but could not break down QPR's packed defence. Frank Lampard had a goal ruled out for offside and the Blues' best effort saw Julio Cesar deny Fernando Torres. This was a far from vintage attacking display from Rafael Benitez's side, who put eight past Aston Villa in their last game on home turf. But what was looking like being a frustrating evening for the Blues turned into a disastrous one at the hands of one of their former players when Wright-Phillips delivered his sucker-punch, 12 minutes from time. The former England winger did not sparkle on too many occasions in four years at Chelsea from 2005 to 2008, following his ??21m move from Manchester City, and he has struggled to make too much of an impression with Rangers either. Wright-Phillips' popularity around Loftus Road will soar after this goal, however. It came after he had been brought off the bench early on to replace the injured Junior Hoilett, and could prove invaluable to Harry Redknapp's side and their bid to stay up. Things never looked straightforward for Chelsea, who may rue their decision to begin with Juan Mata and Eden Hazard on the bench after a defeat that deals a severe blow to their title hopes. The Blues were lucky to keep 11 men on the pitch when Marko Marin marked his first league start by clattering into QPR midfielder Stephane Mbia with a wild lunge after just four minutes. Fortunately for Marin, and for Chelsea, referee Lee Mason elected only to book the German international. But things did not improve much for the home side, who rarely looked like breaking down a determined QPR backline in the first half. Torres, who might soon face competition from Newcastle striker Demba Ba for his starting place, was starved of service as the visitors defended deep and in numbers. Instead it was left to his team-mates to shoot from distance, and nothing summed up Chelsea's lethargic opening better than two horribly wayward efforts from defender Branislav Ivanovic. QPR did not offer much at the other end but, with Adel Taarabt operating as their furthest man forward in a 4-5-1 formation, that was never their intention. Instead they looked to soak up the home side's pressure, a tactic that worked so well that Cesar's first save came just before the break, when he stopped Oscar's deflected shot with an outstretched leg before Victor Moses fired over from the rebound. Rangers had kept only one clean sheet in their last 26 top flight away games - and surrendered meekly against Liverpool three days ago - but they continued to keep Chelsea at bay in the second half. Moses should have done better from a low Marin cross and Ivanovic headed over before Cesar kept out a Torres snap-shot after David Luiz's shot had been blocked. Lampard thought he had drawn level with Kerry Dixon as Chelsea's second highest scorer when he did find the net from a corner, but his celebrations of what would have been his 193rd goal for the club were cut short by the linesman's flag. By now, QPR had created a few half-chances too, but Wright-Phillips' goal still provided a twist in the tale that few had seen coming. Taarabt teed him up on the edge of the area and he drilled a low strike past Ross Turnbull and into the bottom corner of the net. QPR stay bottom, five points adrift of safety, but after three straight defeats, this win will give them renewed hope that survival is not beyond them.  Chelsea interim manager Rafael Benitez on his side's defeat, and his decision to rest several players:  "We were tired and weren't precise. We made a mistake and gave them their chance. "I don't regret the changes because we can't carry on with the same players in every game. "If you're playing a team at the bottom of the table at home, you have to trust your players and I trust them."  QPR boss Harry Redknapp on his players' performance:  "They worked their socks off and they got their rewards, we deserved it and it was a fantastic performance. "They have set the standard tonight and to get out of this mess they have to do it every week."

23.04.2013 09:50:59 Luis Suarez took his Premier League tally to 15 goals for the season by scoring twice to help Liverpool ease to victory against Sunderland. Watched by new Anfield signing Daniel Sturridge, Raheem Sterling's lobbed goal gave the Reds an early lead. Suarez doubled Liverpool's advantage soon after, racing into the area before stabbing the ball home. The Uruguayan then made it 3-0 early in the second half with a close-range strike from Steven Gerrard's pass. The win means Liverpool have recorded back-to-back league victories for the second time this season and moves them up to eighth in the table. For Sunderland it was their second successive defeat following the 2-1 loss to Tottenham at the weekend and they remain 14th. Liverpool's attacking display would have impressed Sturridge, who completed the formalities of his move from Chelsea in the hours before kick-off. Despite a confident start by Sunderland, it was the home side who were the first to threaten in the 11th minute when Suarez was fouled just outside the area and Stewart Downing curled the resulting free-kick towards the near post, but keeper Simon Mignolet did well to push the ball behind for a corner. Liverpool's opening goal came eight minutes later. Suarez brought a Gerrard pass under control before expertly lofting the ball over the defence to release Sterling and the young England winger showed great composure to draw out Mignolet before lobbing the ball into the net. The Sunderland defence were struggling to deal with Liverpool's pacey attacks and the hosts took full advantage by adding a second in the 26th minute. Gerrard knocked the ball forward for Suarez to chase down the right and, though the Uruguayan was fouled by Carlos Cuellar, he stayed on his feet to charge towards goal and power a neat finish beyond Mignolet. Despite the two-goal deficit, Sunderland still carried a threat when they got forward and they had a great chance to pull a goal back when Adam Johnson's deep cross found Matthew Kilgallon inside the area, but the defender's half volley was superbly denied by Pepe Reina. Sterling and Suarez continued to combine well and cause Sunderland problems after the break, and a fine move involving the pair should have brought a third goal five minutes into the second half. Suarez smartly clipped a Gerrard pass forward to send Sterling clear again, but this time the 18-year-old could not match the composure he showed for his goal as he fizzed a shot well wide. Liverpool did add a third two minutes later when Gerrard delivered a pass from 60 yards for Suarez to collect and shoot beyond Mignolet from close range. From then on, Liverpool were firmly in control and had plenty of chances to add to their advantage. A Gerrard shot deflected off Glen Johnson towards goal but Mignolet did well to push the ball over the bar, before the Sunderland keeper raced out to deny Suarez his hat-trick. Both Johnson and substitute Joe Allen had efforts ruled out for offside, but with the damage already done, Liverpool comfortably saw out the remainder of the game to ensure 2013 got off to the ideal start.  Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers said: "The star was our team. Luis Suarez got two goals and Raheem Sterling got one but that is their job and the team was brilliant. "It was the fourth game in a short period of time and their work rate and intensity was incredible. I am very, very happy, it is another win for us and we can look forward to the next game. "Luis has been absolutely fantastic. He moves well, he is a real threat and he is a real pleasure to work with. He is that Lionel Messi type of player in that he gets kicked all over the place but he gets up and he produces."  Sunderland manager Martin O'Neill said: "At half time in the game we felt as if we could have got a goal and we perhaps created the better chances, but we were unable to take them. "They got the third goal and that was important. If we scored before then it would have got us back into the game but at 3-0, Liverpool are very strong. "With the Christmas period we have had, if you had said we would get six points from four games against the teams we have played, I probably would have accepted that. It is up to us now, we have some points on board but it is still a tough old time."

23.04.2013 09:50:59 Southampton climbed out of the Premier League relegation zone after securing a draw with Arsenal but were unfortunate not to pick up all three points. The Saints went ahead when Gaston Ramirez seized on a loose ball and drilled past Wojciech Szczesny. But Arsenal hit back before the break when Guly do Prado diverted Theo Walcott's free-kick into his own net. Ramirez thought he had given the hosts the lead but his sharp strike was ruled out for a foul on Laurent Koscielny. A winning goal would have been just reward for a performance in which Southampton largely outplayed their illustrious opponents. After losing their first four league games, the Saints have only suffered two defeats in their last 10 and have now leapfrogged Wigan to exit the relegation zone on goal difference. In attack, Ramirez and Rickie Lambert were a constant menace to the Gunners defence, whilst at the other end Theo Walcott was starved of service after being given another chance to press his claims for a regular starting berth up front. Walcott cut a forlorn figure in an Arsenal side that was a pale imitation of the team that scored 15 goals in winning their previous four games. Manager Arsene Wenger fielded the same eleven that had beaten Newcastle 7-3 three days earlier but saw his team fade badly after a bright start. After Santi Cazorla had gone close with a dipping 30-yard strike Arsenal's attacks repeatedly broke down in the final third. Their failings in possession enabled Southampton to grow in confidence and the opening goal reflected their increasing ascendancy in the game. It followed a mix-up in the Gunners defence as both Bacary Sagna and Kieran Gibbs made a hash of their clearances, allowing Ramirez to fire a loose ball past Szczesny. Southampton should really have preserved their lead until half-time but were let down by a misjudgement from Brazilian Do Prado, who needlessly stretched out a leg at Walcott's free-kick from the left wing and diverted the ball past Artur Boruc. Do Prado set out to atone for his error after the break and drew a sharp save from Szczesny at his near post with a rasping drive from outside the area. His effort was the catalyst for another dominant spell from the home side in which Jason Puncheon lashed into the side netting from inside the box and Ramirez drilled a long-range effort over the bar. The Uruguayan was convinced he had given Southampton the lead midway through the half when he took a chipped pass on his chest and swivelled to fire home, but the goal was ruled out for a shove on Koscielny. Both managers made changes in a quest for a winning goal, with Arsenal substitute Gervinho firing into the side netting and Mikel Arteta going close from 25 yards. Puncheon then had a late chance to win the match for Southampton but he fired straight at Szczesny and the home side had to settle for a point.  Southampton manager Nigel Adkins: "It was a good performance. Arsenal have been scoring a shed load of goals and we nullified that threat and carried plenty of threat ourselves. "The own-goal was a spawny one that came off his toe but these things happen and we'll get the rub of the green soon. "They started brightly but we stuck out it, grew in confidence and played well."

23.04.2013 09:50:59 Gylfi Sigurdsson scored a late equaliser for Tottenham against Everton to cap a riveting match between two Champions League hopefuls. Spurs took the lead after just 33 seconds when Emmanuel Adebayor converted Jan Vertonghen's low cross. But Everton levelled through Phil Jagielka and took the lead from a fine solo goal by Kevin Mirallas. In a frantic finale, Adebayor struck the post and Sigurdsson slotted home the rebound to claim a vital point. There was still time for Everton to go close as Victor Anichebe ran through on goal and saw his shot smothered by Spurs keeper Hugo Lloris. But a draw seemed a fair result after a spirited attacking performance from two sides making light of the absence of some of their most creative players. Tottenham, deprived of injured trio Gareth Bale, Aaron Lennon and Jermain Defoe, found plenty of flair from Mousa Dembele, Sigurdsson and a rejuvenated Adebayor. And Everton, who were missing the suspended Marouane Fellaini and Steven Pienaar, were once again indebted to the superb Mirallas, whose goal was every bit as eye-catching as his stunning solo winner against Stoke last weekend. It was the home side who started the sharper, however, with their quickest goal in more than 12 years. Vertonghen's whipped low cross from the left flank eluded two Everton players and found Adebayor, who stretched out a leg to steer the ball past Tim Howard. Everton were then presented with their first opportunity by Michael Dawson. The Spurs centre-half's pass was intercepted by Leon Osman, who steadied himself before curling a right-footed effort narrowly wide of the far post. They did not have long to wait for their equaliser, a Baines corner after 15 minutes picking out Jagielka, who climbed above Vertonghen to head the ball through Lloris's legs. Watched by former star Paul Gascoigne, Tottenham enjoyed more of the ball for the remainder of the half without creating many clear openings. They appealed for a penalty before half-time when Clint Dempsey's cross appeared to strike Darron Gibson's arm but replays suggested the ball struck him on the shoulder. Everton began the second half on the front foot and had already gone close through Gibson when a moment of brilliance from Mirallas gave the visitors the lead. The agile Belgian darted inside from the right, skipped past Scott Parker and Steven Caulker and placed a shot into the far corner. Mirallas's effort was almost cancelled out by his countryman Dembele moments later, the midfielder's strike taking a deflection off John Heitinga before being parried onto the underside of the bar by Tim Howard. Suddenly the game was alive with defenders tackling and blocking desperately at either end. For Spurs, the lively Adebayor worked some space in the area but stuck straight at Howard and Dempsey curled a shot around the post. With Everton's players defending deep inside their own half, the Toffees looked on course for three points as the game entered the final five minutes. But inspiration arrived for Tottenham in the form of right-back Kyle Walker. Sprinting down the wing, he cut the ball back for Adebayor, whose curling effort stuck the post and rolled across goal for Sigurdsson to tap home. The intervention of Lloris to deny Anichebe proved just as crucial as Spurs sealed a point that keeps them in touch with Champions League rivals Chelsea and Arsenal.

23.04.2013 09:50:59 Manchester City had to be patient against a determined Stoke side but ran out comfortable winners to stay seven points behind Premier League leaders Manchester United. The Potters visited the Etihad Stadium on the back of a 10-game unbeaten run and with a game-plan of frustrating the champions. It was a tactic that worked for most of the first half until Pablo Zabaleta broke the deadlock and, from then on, the hosts were comfortable. Edin Dzeko gave Roberto Mancini's men breathing space after the break and Sergio Aguero sealed a one-sided win from a penalty awarded after Steven Nzonzi had fouled David Silva outside the box. The margin of victory was a welcome boost for Manchester City's goal difference, although United outscored them in their win at Wigan.  But in a week where he bemoaned his inability to sign Robin van Persie in the summer, Mancini will be cheered by the fact that, with his side scoring seven goals in their last two games, his strikers appear to be firing again. Only a late hamstring injury to Aguero, who was by far the home side's most effective attacking force from the first whistle, took the shine off their day. The game was barely a minute old when the Argentine striker met a James Milner cross but saw his shot blocked by Asmir Begovic at his near post. That set the tone for a first half that turned into an almost endless exercise of attack versus defence, with the champions unable to take their chances when they found a way through Stoke's massed defence. Aguero was wasteful when he fired over after running on to Gareth Barry's clipped pass but went a lot closer when he shaved the post with a header from another Barry delivery and saw a fizzing shot clawed away by Begovic. With the score still goalless, frustration among the home fans inside the Etihad Stadium was growing, although it was directed at Stoke's perceived time-wasting tactics rather than their own side's shortcomings in front of goal. It was Zabaleta who put the latter right just before half-time, taking advantage of some uncharacteristically poor Stoke defending to advance unchallenged from the right touchline with Milner, and tuck away the loose ball after Begovic blocked Milner's cross. The pattern of the game did not change after the break, with the title contenders still the only side who looked like scoring, and they did not take long to put the game beyond Stoke's reach. Dzeko, who had already crashed a dipping first-time shot over the bar, was in the right place to slot home when Begovic spilled Aguero's angled shot. Stoke, at last, ventured forward with intent and Joe Hart was forced into his first meaningful action of the game when he clawed away Charlie Adam's free-kick, before Jon Walters skewed a shot over from close range. The Potters' chances of a comeback still looked remote, however, and they were ended completely when Aguero made it 3-0 from the spot. There was still time for Glenn Whelan to force a late diving save from Hart, with the England keeper pushing his shot on to a post. But the only late drama at the Etihad Stadium was the injury to Aguero, who limped off late on. The champions can ill-afford to be without one of their most potent strikers for much of 2013.  Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini: "We played very well, like we played against Norwich and Sunderland, but sometimes it's not enough to play very well, it's important to score. "In the first half we deserved to score two or three goals, but it was difficult because Stoke is the best defence in the Premier League. "It was important to keep a clean sheet, because if we start to score and don't concede a goal we can have a chance to recover these points."  Stoke City manager Tony Pulis: "We've come here and played right at our maximum, and they've played below par. We didn't play as well as we can play, and they played well. "Sometimes you have to be a little bit grounded, not get carried away and look at facts and figures. When you have spent that much money on the quality they have, it's always difficult. "We've played Tottenham, Liverpool then Southampton with 10 men for the last 25 minutes so it's been tough. Coming here, against one of the best teams in the Premier League, the lads looked tired in the second half. They kept going, they had great spirit, great commitment and I'm not criticising them at all."

23.04.2013 09:50:59 Danny Graham scored a stoppage-time equaliser to deny Aston Villa victory at the Liberty Stadium. Christian Benteke appeared to have given Villa victory with an 85th-minute penalty after Nathan Dyer had fouled Andreas Weimann. But Graham fired home from eight yards to clinch a point for the hosts. Wayne Routledge's early strike had given Swansea the lead while Michu twice hit the post, before Weimann equalised before just half-time. The thrilling finale had seemed unlikely in the opening stages when Swansea, with top scorer Michu returning as one of five changes, cut Villa to shreds. But Villa, after conceding 15 goals in their previous three games, showed a fighting spirit which had been lacking over Christmas. Manager Paul Lambert's policy of giving youth a chance saw him select the youngest Villa team ever to take the field in the Premier League with an average age of just 23 years and 119 days. Swansea dominated the first half but went in at half-time all square after missing a host of good chances. Routledge fired the Swans ahead in the ninth minute with his second opening of the match, after good work by Leon Britton and Pablo Hernandez. Within a minute Michu hit the post and then Graham fired a left-foot shot wide when he should have scored. Michu produced a sublime drag-back inside the box to leave the Villa defence flat-footed, but goalkeeper Brad Guzan got enough on the shot to guide it onto the post. Then Swansea were caught against the run of play just before the interval. Benteke controlled well in midfield and his pass wrong-footed Ashley Williams to find Weimann, who fired a first-time shot low past Michel Vorm's outstretched right hand. It was Villa's first goal since their 3-1 win at Liverpool on 17 December. Villa had a let-off early in the second half when referee Mark Halsey ruled Joe Bennett handled the ball outside the box, though it was a close call. But Villa were showing a lot more fight than in recent weeks, with Marc Albrighton making a nuisance of himself and Bennett looking lively down the left flank. And Benteke and Weimann caused panic as Chico Flores failed to clear, but Weimann's shot was well wide. Dyer cleared a powerful Benteke header off the line, but the little winger brought down Weimann as he attempted to retrieve the ball and conceded the penalty. Benteke stepped up and sent Vorm the wrong way. The Swans threw everything at Villa in a bad-tempered finale, and finally got their reward when the ball fell to Graham eight yards out and he needed two attempts to beat Guzan with a powerful right-foot shot.  Swansea manager Michael Laudrup: "We could have been 4-0 up after 12 minutes. Incredible. "Aston Villa really fought after three defeats. They wanted to do everything to get a point and got close to getting three points. It was a great fight back from us, we showed character. We could have lost but should have won. "Obviously it should have been two penalties. The Aston Villa player had two feet on the line and last time I read the rules on the line is in the box. His  hand is also in the box so it should have been a penalty but that's life."  Aston Villa manager Paul Lambert: "It is hard to take because at 30 seconds to go, you expect to see it through. In the first half, Swansea were right on top but in the second half we were very good. "We have a lot of injuries so you have to give credit to the players. It is a big point for us. "I've got a lot of faith in what we're doing and we won't deviate from it. Even after the heavy defeats we were keeping spirits up."

23.04.2013 09:50:59 Tottenham moved up to third in the Premier League table as they claimed a deserved victory against Reading. The visitors went ahead when Pavel Pogrebnyak headed in a rebound after Ian Harte's free-kick hit the crossbar. But Spurs equalised only five minutes later, Michael Dawson with a diving header from Gylfi Sigurdsson's corner. Emmanuel Adebayor's powerful header from Aaron Lennon's cross put Tottenham ahead, before Clint Dempsey's deflected 25-yard effort sealed victory. Despite Spurs having 30 shots on goal compared to only seven from Reading, the Royals were left regretting their failure to score in a five-minute second-half spell. Pogrebynak had a shot saved by Hugo Lloris, a last-ditch challenge from Kyle Walker denied Jimmy Kebe and Dawson headed an Alex Pearce effort off the goal-line. Tottenham had been the only club in the Premier League not to have conceded a goal in the first 15 minutes of a match this season but that record ended as the visitors took a fourth-minute lead. Pogrebnyak was fouled by Mousa Dembele and Harte's curling free-kick from 25 yards hit the crossbar but the Russian striker reacted first to head his seventh goal of the season. However, Reading's lead did not last long as Dawson out-jumped two defenders to head in an equaliser. The Royals, one of three teams to not win an away Premier League game this season, had to defend for the rest of the half with lone striker Pogrebnyak working hard but seeing little of the ball as Spurs dominated. Jermain Defoe, who scored twice in Spurs' 3-1 win at the Madjeski Stadium in September, put an effort over the bar and later blasted a powerful shot wide. The visitors were hanging on as goalkeeper Adam Federici reacted to save a deflected shot from Sandro and also gathered Dembele's effort at the second attempt as Adebayor waited to pounce. Ex-Reading man Sigurdsson, who replaced the suspended Gareth Bale, also had a shot blocked and Dembele was unlucky to shoot narrowly wide. Spurs maintained their pressure early in the second half when Defoe was again denied by Federici. But the goalkeeper could do nothing as Tottenham took a deserved lead when Adebayor scored only his second Premier League goal of the season. Lennon got to the byline and dinked a cross to the back post where Adebayor beat Pearce in the air to power a header past Federici. Spurs, who have dropped points at home against West Brom, Norwich, Wigan and Stoke already this season, pushed for a third with Sandro, Lennon and Kyle Naughton all wasting chances. The hosts had dominated but nearly paid the price for their misses as Pogrebynak beat Jan Vertonghen and had two opportunities but Lloris made his only save of the game before Pogrebynak headed the rebound wide. Jimmy Kebe also had a late chance when he was denied by a last-ditch challenge before Dawson headed Pearce's effort off the line. But the home fans could relax when substitute Dempsey's shot took a huge deflection off Mikele Leigertwood with the ball looping up past Federici to seal Tottenham's win, their seventh in nine Premier League matches, while Reading remain 19th, five points adrift of safety.  Tottenham manager Andre Villas-Boas said:  "It was a difficult game in the beginning and the early goal gave them hope. "But we did well to close out the festive period with 10 points from four games and hopefully we will continue this form to put ourselves in the position we want to be. "Aaron Lennon is such a magnificent player and sometimes he does not get the recognition he deserves but his form has been extraordinary. He has been magnificent for us, scoring goals like last week, and is such a good player. "The three points have meant we have opened a bit of a gap over West Brom, Everton are still there and Arsenal have a fixture to play."  Reading manager Brian McDermott said:  "It was frustrating to concede an equaliser straight after scoring and if we could have had it at 1-0 at half-time then it would've been a really good game. "Even when they were 2-1 up we had three great opportunities and they scored a deflected goal to win it. "But at 2-1 we were right in it; their goalkeeper has made a decent save and Jimmy Kebe was denied by decent defending from Kyle Walker. "This is a really good Tottenham side that Andre has built here and not many people will come away from here taking points."

23.04.2013 09:51:00 Mark Noble's controversial early penalty set West Ham on their way to a comfortable victory which consigned Norwich to a fourth consecutive defeat. Noble calmly found the corner after three minutes when Ryan Bennett was deemed to have held down Winston Reid. Norwich almost levelled when a Robert Snodgrass free-kick hit the post but Joey O'Brien's shot made it 2-0. The hosts were largely untroubled after the break and secured the win despite Russell Martin's 90th-minute strike. Defender Martin's third goal in two games produced a nervy finale, but could not prevent the Hammers leapfrogging their visitors and moving up to 11th place in the Premier League table. The margin of victory - just West Ham's second in nine games - could have been far greater with Canaries goalkeeper Mark Bunn having to make several superb saves and the hosts also wasting a couple of glorious opportunities. But Norwich will point to the harsh second-minute penalty award as the catalyst for their demise. Three defeats in a row over Christmas had marred a 10-game unbeaten run for Norwich. And although all three of those losses were against sides in the top seven - including Manchester City and Chelsea - the last thing their fragile confidence needed was to be chasing the game within three minutes. But like the home reverse against City, that is exactly what happened. Their normally calm manager Chris Hughton was furious and bemused in equal measure as referee Mark Clattenburg penalised Bennett for grabbing Reid's shirt as a looping ball was played into the box. Reid seemed to be impeding Bennett just as as much but Noble ignored the protests and stayed cool to convert the spot-kick and put the hosts ahead. Norwich refused to be rattled, but a side deprived of both injured main strikers Grant Holt and Steve Morison struggled to create chances. Despite a willing display from on-loan Tottenham teenager Harry Kane, they lacked punch and presence up front and West Ham cleverly stifled the main creative threat from the ever-lively Wes Hoolahan. Snodgrass was desperately unlucky with a brilliant 20-yard free-kick that hit the post with the score at 1-0, and they appealed for penalties of their own when the ball hit Reid on the arm, and then after the break when Kane tumbled in the box under a challenge from James Tomkins. But West Ham, with Noble in dominant form and midfield partner Jack Collison equally impressive on his first start this season, played with a greater tempo and created the majority of the chances. Bunn pulled off a breathtaking one-handed reaction stop to keep out Collison's effort just before the hosts made it 2-0 when O'Brien continued his run into the box to sidefoot home from 10 yards after great work by Noble. Norwich appealed for a foul by Carlton Cole on Alex Tettey in the build up but Clattenburg waved play on, much to Hughton's disgust. Matthew Taylor's fierce 20-yard strike then forced a save from Bunn before the otherwise impressive Cole produced a terrible miss when he somehow skied the ball over the bar from three yards after a fabulous move on the right involving Noble and Guy Demel. West Ham sat deeper after the break and Norwich saw much more of the ball but were still unable to create much. Kane appealed hopefully after tumbling when racing through on goal while at the other end the Hammers almost added a third goal when Ricardo Vaz Te's header hit the post. But West Ham did not need the security of a third despite Martin pulling a goal back with just over 30 seconds of normal time remaining when he did brilliantly to volley into the corner of the net from substitute Elliott Bennett's right-wing cross.  West Ham manager Sam Allardyce:  "I was wondering if we were going to hold our confidence and performance level at home. It has been really good even though we have had two back-to-back defeats. They showed they have the mentality to cope with whatever is thrown at them. "We are glad that their goal didn't come a bit earlier but it's a shame the score did not reflect how well we played. We should have scored a few more and and we did it with really good football. We deserved the win. "Often in a crowded penalty box it is impossible to give penalties like that, but I could see it from where I was in the dugout. That early goal gave us the confidence to go on. "The disappointing thing was the chances the front lads missed, with balls just flashing across the box needed a tap in. "We lost a goal in the 90th minute which made us edgy in the end when we should have been out of sight. We will continue to try to brush up on our finishing techniques with the lads and hope the next time round we are more clinical with our finishing."  Norwich City boss Chris Hughton:  "The key decisions in the game did not go in our favour, but we did not start well enough. "We accept Ryan Bennett had hold of the lad's shirt, but I also saw Reid's forearm in Ryan's chest. They are very close, he is not pulling Reid so he cannot get away, it is something you see game in and game out right throughout the country. "On almost every occasion you do not see a penalty, particularly when it is so early in the game, so I was very surprised when he gave it. "I also don't accept it was not a foul on Alex Tettey leading up to the second goal and certainly was a handball in the first half and then the incident on Harry Kane. We have been on the end of poor decisions. "We showed in the second half a bit more of what we are about. Nobody has really given us a beating and they have all been really close games. We have to be at our best to get results and we have been close in the last four games."

23.04.2013 09:51:00 Javier Hernandez and Robin van Persie scored twice as Premier League leaders Manchester United coasted past Wigan to preserve their seven-point advantage. The Mexican striker side-footed the opener after Ali Al Habsi had parried Patrice Evra's shot into his path. United went 2-0 up when Van Persie turned Ivan Ramis and curled a sublime shot into the far corner. Hernandez lashed home Van Persie's deflected free-kick before the Dutchman turned in Danny Welbeck's low cross. United's eighth win in nine league games maintained their grip on top spot in the table at the end of a busy Christmas schedule and provided a fitting way for manager Sir Alex Ferguson to celebrate turning 71 on New Year's Eve. Wigan, in contrast, appear destined for their annual relegation fight after sliding to 17th place, just one point above the drop zone. A lively start from United showed their determination to avoid a repeat of last April, when a shock 1-0 defeat at the DW Stadium contributed to them surrendering an eight-point lead to Manchester City in the title race and set Wigan on the road to safety. The recalled Hernandez was a lively spearhead to United's attack and, after firing his first chance straight at Al Habsi from a narrow angle, he collected a Ryan Giggs pass and drilled into the net, only to be correctly denied by the linesman's flag. Another sublime delivery from Giggs almost provided Hernandez with a tap-in, but the ball was expertly whipped away from his toes by Maynor Figueroa. With United in the ascendancy, Al Habsi was the busiest man on the field, saving a free-kick from Van Persie and a deflected drive from Rafael. But when a corner from the right was never properly cleared, United's pressure finally bore fruit. Evra picked up Jonny Evans's pass and unleashed a powerful drive, which was pushed one-handed by Al Habsi into the path of Hernandez, who side-footed first time into the roof of the net. Al Habsi could do nothing to prevent United's second goal, which was down to the individual brilliance of Van Persie. Found by Hernandez inside the area, the former Arsenal striker left Ramis on the floor with a sharp turn and whipped a right-footed shot into the net. United almost extended their lead shortly after the restart as Van Persie played Hernandez into space but the striker fired wastefully wide. Wigan thought they had secured a lifeline when Arouna Kone turned in Franco Di Santo's low cross, but the Ivory Coast striker was ruled to have strayed a fraction offside. United reacted to the scare with characteristic ruthlessness as Hernandez secured the points with his team's third goal. Van Persie's free-kick rebounded off the wall into the Mexican's path and was expertly drilled past Al Habsi. A comfortable afternoon for United was complete when Van Persie capitalised on a horrible mix-up in the home side's defence to score his 19th goal of the season. Jean Beausejour ran into his team-mate Emmerson Boyce and presented the ball to substitute Welbeck, whose square pass was easily turned in by the prolific Dutchman.

23.04.2013 09:51:00 Dimitar Berbatov and Alex Kacaniklic scored as Fulham claimed only their second away win of the season against high-flying West Brom. Berbatov put the Cottagers ahead with a low strike before Romelu Lukaku equalised just after the break with a close-range effort. Lukaku and Zoltan Gera both hit the post for the Baggies. But Kacaniklic secured the deserved win for the visitors after a clever ball from Bryan Ruiz set up his low strike. It has certainly been a very different first half of the season for these two sides as West Brom fly high under the tutelage of Steve Clarke with their highest-ever points tally for this time of the year. On the contrary, Martin Jol's side had won only one game in the last 12 before this after a promising start to the campaign and only earned one victory on their travels so far this season - at Wigan in September. However, they got their second away win here and it was Jol's side who got off to the better start with the early pressure as Steve Sidwell flashed a shot over the bar. It was a subdued New Year's Day atmosphere early on at The Hawthorns, even when Gareth McAuley headed wide for the hosts and Lukaku had a close-range effort blocked. Berbatov was pulling the strings for Fulham but wasted a great chance on the half-hour mark when he hit a lazy effort well over after West Brom's Chris Brunt failed to clear. However, Berbatov showed his real class to get his seventh goal of the season. His long pass out wide sent Ashkan Dejagah down the right before the Bulgarian trotted to the edge of the area to receive the ball back from his team-mate before sliding his shot through Ben Foster's legs. West Brom were level within moments of the restart as Billy Jones took advantage of some poor defending down the right as he weaved into space before crossing for Lukaku who turned the ball home - although the on-loan Chelsea striker may have been offside. After the drab opening half, this was a pulsating start to the second period and Lukaku struck the outside of the post when Aaron Hughes failed to clear. The Baggies striker then forced a good stop from Fulham goalkeeper David Stockdale before former Cottager Zoltan Gera struck the post on the rebound and then Hughes headed away the following effort from Brunt. Fulham were back ahead in the 58th minute as Ruiz's superb ball put Kacaniklic in and he turned McAuley and Jones on the edge of the area before coolly sliding the ball under Foster. Only Stoke and Manchester City had left this ground with three points this term before this result and second-half substitute Shane Long tried to preserve West Brom's record but his stoppage-time flick from close range was saved by Stockdale.  West Brom manager Steve Clarke: "I don't think we played as we can do. First half we were way off the mark. I'm not sure if it was the consequence of four games in 10 days or not. "In the second half it was better, we did the hard work to get back into it but then we gave it away. We could not quite get the second equaliser. "Nobody can question the character of the team. Right at the death, with a bit of luck, we would have got the goal that our second-half performance deserved."  Fulham manager Martin Jol: "To win against a West Brom side who are flying - that is a great way to start the new year. "I was very happy with the performance from everyone. If you lose games and don't do well, Berbatov is the first to get criticised because of his body language but I can assure you he always wants to win. "I thought overall for the boys it was good for our confidence because we were struggling results wise. Our away record is not fantastic but this is our second win and we should have won maybe three of the four draws."

23.04.2013 09:51:00 A woeful QPR display intensified their relegation fears as they were beaten by a Luis Suarez-inspired Liverpool.  Reds' boss Brendan Rodgers was absent from the game with a bug but Suarez twice capitalised on poor defending to put the visitors 2-0 ahead. QPR were denied a penalty when Adel Taarabt's free-kick hit the arm of Jordan Henderson, before Daniel Agger headed in Liverpool's third. Steven Gerrard's shot was cleared off QPR's goal-line as the Reds won easily. Bottom-of-the-table QPR tamely went down to a 12th league defeat in 20 games this season and had the air of a side resigned to relegation, with eight points separating them from safety. They had seen fellow bottom three sides Reading win and Southampton draw on Saturday and, while the least QPR might have showed is the stomach for a survival fight, they were missing that quality to an alarming scale. Liverpool were quicker, hungrier and stronger and, although they were allowed the freedom to dominate the game, they did so with some delightful play which should help Rodgers feel better. The livewire and menacing Suarez was again key to their win and he put his side 2-0 up in the first 16 minutes. He jinked past a defender and had a 20-yard shot parried away, before giving his side the lead when he eased past centre-back Clint Hill and slotted a shot into the bottom corner. The Uruguayan's second came when his low cross was cleared back to him by the sliding Nedum Onuoha to leave Suarez to side-foot in his 13th league goal of the season. QPR playmaker Taarabt had a fair shout for a penalty when his free-kick hit the arm of Henderson, although referee Anthony Taylor was unmoved. But QPR were crumbling against the endeavour and quality of the visitors and conceded a third when Agger headed in Gerrard's cross. Soon after, Suarez shrugged off defenders Onuoha and Ryan Nelsen, before teeing up Gerrard - whose shot was cleared off the goal-line. QPR fans booed their side off at half-time and their side continued to be outplayed after the break. A Suarez shot was well saved by Julio Cesar, while Henderson shot high. QPR midfielder Stephane Mbia curled a rare shot wide but the efforts came way too late. The home side were 2-0 down with 13 minutes left against Liverpool last season before rescuing a 3-2 win which kick-started them beating the drop. There was no such turnaround this time around, with Chelsea and Tottenham next up in the top flight for the Loftus Road club.  Liverpool assistant manager Colin Pascoe:  "That's probably the best we have played for a long time with the display in the first half. The way we took our chances was pleasing. "Luis Suarez is superb. He's a maverick. He creates chances for himself, finishes them and is a great lad. "It was great result from the lads and the way we performed in the first half secured the win. We were disappointed with the defeat by Stoke on Boxing Day and the response from the players was terrific."

23.04.2013 09:51:00 Frank Lampard served a timely reminder of his goal-scoring ability as his double carried Chelsea back to third with a hard-earned win over Everton. The 34-year-old, who is out of contract in the summer, headed in Ramires' cross and stabbed in from close range after his side had conceded in 62 seconds. Steven Pienaar gave Everton an early lead, following in after Victor Anichebe nodded against the post. Nikica Jelavic hit the bar and missed a late chance as the hosts fell short. Chelsea's fourth successive league win under interim boss Rafael Benitez, after failing to win in his first three, means the Blues finish 2012 four points off Manchester City and 11 off leaders Manchester United, but with a game in hand on both. Whether Lampard finishes 2013 with the Stamford Bridge club remains in doubt, with the England midfielder free to agree pre-contract terms with a foreign club in January. For all the promise of Oscar and Eden Hazard and the undoubted ability of Juan Mata, Chelsea's travelling fans made it clear that they believed that it is to soon to consign Lampard, who joined the club 11 and a half years ago, to Chelsea history. His goals brought to an end Everton's formidable unbeaten run at Goodison, which stretched back 14 previous games to March's 1-0 defeat by Arsenal.  The home team certainly settled into the match like a team at ease in their surroundings, scoring with their first attack. In the absence of Seamus Coleman and Phil Neville, Phil Jagielka roamed forward from his unaccustomed right-back spot to deliver a cross that Anichebe nodded against the woodwork. Pienaar gleefully dispatched low past Petr Cech. With the South African and his midfield partner Leon Osman weaving dangerously in the spaces between David Luiz and Lampard, Everton continued to pen Chelsea back after the opener. Jelavic smacked the post with a free-kick after he and Pienaar had hustled Gary Cahill out of possession - and Osman's first-time effort demanded a smart save from Cech. The home fans revelled in their early dominance, taunting Fernando Torres and Rafael Benitez, so long Liverpool figureheads, on their return to Merseyside. But it was the third of Chelsea's Spanish contingent - Mata - who looked likeliest to silence a boisterous Goodison. A last-ditch block from Johnny Heitinga denied the former Valencia man, before his probing prised apart Everton again; Ashley Cole inches away from turning in from Cesar Azpilicueta's subsequent cross. Chelsea's equaliser capped a spell of pressure and ensured Lampard a Premier League haul of five or more goals for the 16th successive season. Manager David Moyes could not inspire a repeat of Everton's rollicking start to the match as Chelsea, despite the half-time withdrawal of Cech with an ankle injury, started better after the break. Torres drifted dangerously into space behind Leighton Baines but mis-controlled Luiz's pass, strayed offside to ruin a delicious move, and had a sweetly struck snap-shot from 20 yards saved by Tim Howard. Without the presence of Marouane Fellaini, who was serving the final game of a three-match ban, Everton struggled to capitalise on the industry and invention of Pienaar and Baines down the left. The one time that Jelavic met a Baines delivery, his stooping header beat substitute goalkeeper Ross Turnbull but not the bar. Three minutes later Chelsea were in front for the first time. Mata was instrumental, crossing for Hazard to nod down before Lampard instinctively volleyed home after the Spaniard's initial effort had been palmed back into the six-yard box. Jelavic squandered a fine chance to level in injury-time, swiping thin air as he attempted to smash home a Baines cross, but Chelsea could have already made the game safe when Sylvain Distin stretched to intervene as Torres bore down on Howard in the final minute.  Everton manager David Moyes : "We're not disappointed because we played really well and we've run the European champions really close. but we didn't quite have enough in the end. "We had played well enough to get a second goal but had been unfortunate, having shots back off the woodwork. "I thought we were a bit unlucky. We tried to make what we had work the best we could today and for long periods I thought we did."

23.04.2013 09:51:00 Theo Walcott scored three goals and set up two more as Arsenal overcame Newcastle in a 10-goal thriller and climbed to fifth in the Premier League. Walcott, out of contract in the summer, swept Arsenal in front but Demba Ba equalised with a deflected free-kick. After Sylvain Marveaux tapped in to cancel out Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's low shot, Lukas Podolski nodded home. Ba levelled again, only for Walcott to score twice more, either side of a brace from substitute Olivier Giroud. Giroud hit the bar as Arsenal pushed for an eighth, but the result was secure and Arsenal extended their winning run to four games. Emirates Stadium was engulfed by chants of "sign him up" as the full-time whistle approached, a reference to Walcott's contract dispute. He has scored 14 goals in all competitions this season and four in three games since being deployed as the central striker. His first effort, in particular, carried shades of Thierry Henry - Arsenal's record goalscorer who was watching from the stands and is training with the club during the Major League Soccer off-season. It is hard to imagine Arsenal letting the 23-year-old leave if he continues to produce performances of this level. Walcott left Newcastle stunned but while they are still without an away league win this term, they should take heart from impressive displays at Manchester United and Arsenal over the festive period. They had four days less than Arsenal to prepare - the Gunners' Boxing Day visit of West Ham was postponed - yet enjoyed plenty of early possession and Ba headed just over from Marveaux's corner. Newcastle were punished for a high defensive line when Walcott latched on to Podolski's through ball and curled past Tim Krul - but Alan Pardew's men responded well and were rewarded. Bacary Sagna conceded a needless free-kick outside the box and Ba's set piece took a heavy deflection off Jack Wilshere to elude Szczesny. After half-time Podolski nodded Danny Simpson's throw to Santi Cazorla and he set up Oxlade-Chamberlain to drill past Krul, only for Gabriel Obertan to beat Sagna and cross for Marveaux to tap in. The momentum was shifting like a pendulum and no sooner had Podolski headed Arsenal back in front after Wilshere's run and cross than Newcastle struck again for 3-3. A weaving run from the outstanding Marveaux ended with a cross to the back post that let Ba ghost past Kieran Gibbs and convert. Despite Pardew signalling to his players that they must not concede again, his message went unheeded as Walcott clipped his second. The introduction of Giroud gave Arsenal a new dimension and the Frenchman headed in a Walcott cross before drilling past Krul. With Newcastle tiring, Walcott shimmied his way past several defenders to chip Krul from a tight angle and seal his hat-trick.  Newcastle boss Alan Pardew: "We have given away soft goals and the match has got away from us. It was a heavy pitch at Old Trafford and we looked leggy after our exertions there. "We did not have the energy to cope with them in the last 20 minutes. We put the ball at risk too often and some of the goals we gave away were not good enough for us. "There was a clear difference between the two sides in the last part of the match. We got overrun, but we have to defend as a team. I don't want to put all the focus on the defence and the back four." On whether Demba Ba will leave the club: "It will be what it will be. There is nothing we can do about that - the clause is there and that is that."

23.04.2013 09:51:00 Wigan Athletic moved out of the Premier League relegation zone and above Aston Villa with an emphatic victory over their struggling hosts. Wigan made the perfect start when Ivan Ramis escaped his marker to meet Jean Beausejour's corner with a firm header. Brett Holman smashed a half-volley against the crossbar as Villa briefly threatened before the interval. Emmerson Boyce calmly slotted in after a superb one-two with Arouna Kone, who added the third from a tight angle. Hordes of frustrated Villa supporters headed for the exits immediately after Kone completed a routine win that lifts the Latics above Villa into 16th place. It was another difficult afternoon for Paul Lambert's men, who have endured a nightmare Christmas period with heavy defeats against Chelsea and Tottenham.  Most of the pre-match talk centred on how their young side, with an average age of 23, would react to conceding 12 goals in their previous two matches. But they made the worst possible start by conceding their 13th goal in just 183 minutes - after being let down by basic defensive errors at a Wigan set-piece. The visitors' central defender Ramis, making his first start since late November following a hamstring injury, easily escaped his marker Christian Benteke and took advantage with a powerful eight-yard header from Beausejour's left-wing corner. The Latics grew in confidence, stroking the ball around as a leaderless-looking Villa chased after their visitors, but Wigan failed to stretch home keeper Brad Guzan again before half-time, despite creating a number of decent opportunities to double their lead. Wigan midfielder Shaun Maloney appealed for a penalty after he felt he was impeded by Villa's Stephen Ireland and also fired over from Beausejour's pull-back following the Chilean winger's clever run down the left. The hosts finally managed to build some sustained pressure as half-time loomed, Benteke drilling low into the net with the flag already raised against an offside Andreas Weimann. And they should have been level at the break when Joe Bennett's deep free-kick was nodded down by Benteke to the far post where Holman's effort beat Al Habsi but hit the crossbar. Villa started the second half by creating another opportunity which Benteke headed over but within six minutes they were further behind, Latics defender Boyce bursting through the Villa midfield before stylishly finishing past Guzan after exchanging one-touch passes with Kone. It was killer blow for an already demoralised Villa and Wigan, who had not won in their previous six matches, capitalised on the hosts' fragile confidence with a third goal. Kone, recently called up by Ivory Coast for their Africa Cup of Nations squad having missed the past two tournaments, brushed aside a weak challenge from Matthew Lowton to race on to Franco Di Santo's pass and round Guzan before converting. Villa's dismal day ended with those home fans still inside the half-empty Villa Park ironically cheering substitute Jordan Bowery's late shot on target - though there was some solace as Stoke's late equaliser against Southampton at least stopped them sliding into the bottom three.  Wigan manager Roberto Martinez:  "I felt from the first second the players were really focused. It was very important for us to keep a clean sheet but what they did going forward was first-class. "The movement was very precise and the penetration was very good. I thought we could have got a few more goals if that final pass was cuter. "It is not just the win against Aston Villa which is important - it's the three points we wanted. "You can't think anything until you reach 40 points, but today is a massive, massive boost."

23.04.2013 09:51:00 Liverpool and West Ham fought out a largely disappointing goalless draw which damages the home team's European ambitions but eased relegation concerns for their opponents. The Hammers were denied their first win at Anfield for 50 years when Lucas Leiva cleared Jack Collison's late header off the line. Luis Suarez was marshalled expertly by West Ham defender James Collins, although the Uruguay forward did force an injury-time save from Jussi Jaaskelainen at the goalkeeper's near post with a low shot. The draw leaves Liverpool in seventh, three points behind local rivals Everton having played an extra match, while West Ham are now seven points clear of the relegation zone. It also brings the east London side to within a point of the 38-point target manager Sam Allardyce has set before he signs a new contract with the Upton Park club. The central-defensive pairing of Collins and James Tomkins were crucial to securing their side's clean sheet, as Allardyce earned a first point in his last nine games against the Reds. The match had been preceded by a minute's silence in the last game at Anfield before the 24th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster on 15 April. When the action got under way, Liverpool had the majority of possession and looked the more threatening going forward, without creating any clear-cut chances. And it was the visitors who went close to taking the lead when midfielder Mohamed Diame, showing sparks of his quality, beat four Liverpool defenders inside the box before hammering a strike over the bar. Liverpool's frustrations increased when Daniel Sturridge, who replaced Stewart Downing midway through the first half, saw his shot on the turn saved at the far post on the stroke of half-time. After the break, the Merseysiders increased the pressure but the visitors held firm, Tomkins blocking a goal-bound Steven Gerrard effort just in front of the line. The home side did have the ball in the net when Sturridge turned in Jordan Henderson's shot only for the goal to be disallowed for offside. West Ham thought they should have had a penalty for a Jose Enrique tackle on Tomkins, who then might have conceded a spot-kick himself for a challenge on Gerrard. As Liverpool continued to struggle to find a way through the visitors, West Ham almost stole the three points late on but Lucas cleared Collison's header off the goal-line.  Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers:  "The effort the players put in was very good. We just needed a bit of luck to go our way. I'm disappointed Daniel Sturridge's goal was disallowed for offside as I thought it was onside. "You have to give West Ham credit as they defended very well. I never for one moment thought they were going to win it. They got in some great blocks and are an honest group of players that put their bodies on the line but only one team tried to win it and that was us, but we couldn't put the ball in the back of the net."  West Ham manager Sam Allardyce:  "I am content, even though we should have won the game. We nullified Liverpool's strengths and created the better chances to score. I'm delighted. It's only our finishing that has cost us the three points. "Jose Enrique kicked James Tomkins when we should have had a penalty but I am satisfied with the performance and result. We know we've created better chances than Liverpool, even though they had more possession. "James Collins and James Tomkins were outstanding. It's a big point. We are ever closer to the magic 40."

23.04.2013 09:51:00 Swansea recorded their first win in five Premier League games, as Fulham slipped closer to the relegation zone with just two victories in the last three months. Danny Graham, playing in place of injured top scorer Michu up front, gave the visitors a first-half lead, before Jonathan de Guzman made it two. Bryan Ruiz got one back after a scramble on the goal line. But it was not enough, leaving Fulham with just one win in their last 12. Swansea kept up their unbeaten record against Fulham in the Premier League, having done the double over them last season. It also maintained their unique record of winning all six of the games in which they have opened the scoring this season. For Swansea, this was proof there is life without talisman Spanish talisman Michu and Graham made the most of his return to the side with his goal. But Fulham's goalkeeper David Stockdale had a game he would rather forget as two errors were pounced on by the Welsh side. Striker Dimitar Berbatov had the first clear-cut chance to put the home side ahead but he scuffed his kick just inside the six-yard box from a corner and the ball flew over the crossbar. Swansea then took the lead against the run of play when Stockdale made a meal of a relatively easy cross from winger Nathan Dyer, with Graham on hand to score his first Premier League goal since August. Fulham nearly drew level moments later, midfielder Kerim Frei flashing his left-foot strike across goal when he really should have tested Swansea's German goalkeeper Gerhard Tremmel. Tremmel was called into action again towards the end of the half when he parried a left-foot strike by Fulham's Ruiz around his right-hand post. Ruiz had another chance to bring the hosts level just after the break as Tremmel could only watch the Costa Rican's free-kick fly past the post. But Martin Jol's team soon found themselves 2-0 down after Stockdale's clearance hit defender Brede Hangeland and De Guzman pounced. The home side finally scored when Ruiz found the back of the net after the ball broke to him from a Berbatov shot that came back off the bar, the goal going in off Sacha Riether, who Swansea protested was standing offside. Berbatov thought he had levelled when he was first to a Ruiz shot parried by Tremmel but the Bulgarian striker was offside.

23.04.2013 09:51:00 Manchester United will start 2013 with a seven-point lead at the top of the Premier League table after a hard-earned win over West Bromwich Albion. Gareth McAuley deflected Ashley Young's cross past Ben Foster for the opening goal at a rain-lashed Old Trafford. Foster tipped a Young effort onto the bar, before West Brom's Gabriel Tamas wasted a great close-range chance. But United substitute Robin van Persie sealed victory with a curling finish in the 90th minute. This was not as comfortable for United as the scoreline might suggest, with the leaders forced to weather a spirited second-half  display from the Baggies. Nevertheless the outcome was a welcome early birthday present for Sir Alex Ferguson, who is 71 on Monday. The United manager starts the new year with a 13th Premier League title firmly within his sights after his side ended a trophyless 2012 with a victory sprinkled with positives. Shinji Kagawa, back from a knee injury, was influential in his first appearance since October while captain Nemanja Vidic helped United to only their fourth Premier League clean sheet of the season. Ferguson could even afford to start with Van Persie on the bench ahead of Tuesday's match at Wigan Athletic. If there were any grumblings from the home dressing room it was that they forced their fans to endure a tense second half after struggling to add to their early lead until Van Persie's arrival. West Brom deserve praise for the way they reacted after falling behind, with Steve Clarke's side showing why they arrived in Manchester in sixth place in the table. Despite the soggy conditions United passed it around in their usual effortless style. And the hosts broke the deadlock in the ninth minute when McAuley diverted Young's low cross into his own net after Graham Dorrans gifted United possession with a careless clearance. Young, one of five players recalled to the United side, then unleashed a powerful drive from 16 yards which Foster did well to tip onto his bar. Michael Carrick was denied by Tamas's clearance off the line before half-time yet the West Brom player was guilty of a glaring miss during his team's best period after the interval. The Romanian defender was presented with a glorious chance to equalise from close range but instead headed the ball away from the United goal. Peter Odemwingie also went close in front of the Stretford End before Van Persie completed the scoring with a delightful 90th-minute finish. Three days earlier Ferguson had berated the match officials during his side's narrow win over Newcastle but this time he celebrated from the touchline as Van Persie curled the ball over Foster from the edge of the area for his 14th league goal of the season.  Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson:  "He (Robin van Persie) is a fantastic player. He came on and changed the game for us. "Every time the ball came up to him he got hold of it and turned on them. They were having to go back to their box all the time and he has done well. "West Brom were a very resilient, stubborn team. They worked really hard on their defending and closed all their ranks. "You have to deal with that but the slowness of the pitch killed our speed a bit."  West Brom manager Steve Clarke:  "The fact they had to bring some of their big guns off the bench shows how well we were doing. "In the first half we were too timid. "We spoke at half-time about being too respectful and in the end, the scoreline doesn't reflect the way we played."

23.04.2013 09:51:00 Ten-man Manchester City held off a determined Norwich to win a pulsating game at Carrow Road. City surged ahead when Edin Dzeko twice slotted home in the first four minutes. Anthony Pilkington's free-kick gave Norwich hope but, despite the visitors having Samir Nasri sent off, Sergio Aguero added a third for the champions. Norwich's Russell Martin scored twice either side of a Dzeko shot that went in off the post and keeper Mark Bunn, as the visitors clung on for victory. The champions, beaten at Sunderland on Boxing Day, were made to demonstrate their appetite to retain their Premier League title with a victory achieved despite the handicap of losing Nasri to a straight red card on the stroke of half-time. The French winger and Sebastian Bassong squared up to each other after a strong tackle from the latter took both the ball and Nasri, who reacted angrily and appeared to flick his head towards the Canaries defender - though the visitors were clearly aggrieved at what they regarded as a very harsh decision. The talk following the shock defeat at the Stadium of Light had all been about Manchester City's misfiring strikeforce, and their forwards seemed to have taken the criticism to heart judging by the rampant start at Carrow Road. The first goal was beautifully worked as Aguero picked out David Silva on the edge of the area and he slipped a first-time pass to Dzeko, who sent a shot into the bottom corner. Norwich barely had time to regroup before their opponents added a second. Canaries keeper Bunn was tempted out of his goal in an unsuccessful attempt to close down Aguero, who laid the ball back for Dzeko to slot into an empty net. Norwich complained about a challenge from Vincent Kompany on Bradley Johnson in the build-up to the goal but it was allowed to stand. The visitors were then almost gifted a third when home defender Javier Garrido's poor backpass was tipped over the crossbar by a backtracking Bunn. But the Canaries have beaten Arsenal and Manchester United at Carrow Road this season and they responded with Pilkington's 20-yard free-kick, which found the net via a deflection off Gael Clichy. Down to 10 men, Roberto Mancini's side restored their two-goal lead after half-time when Aguero raced on to a Yaya Toure ball before classily dinking the ball over Bunn. But the home side pressed forward undeterred, Jonathan Howson having a shot palmed wide by keeper Joe Hart. From the resulting corner, a Robert Snodgrass cross was nodded back across goal by Bassong and Martin was on hand to guide in a header and reduce the deficit to one again. The visitors might have thought they had put the match out of reach when Dzeko's fierce drive came back off the post and hit keeper Bunn on its way into the net but Norwich were still not finished, Martin grabbing his second when he diverted a Bradley Johnson shot into the net following a goalmouth scramble after 75 minutes. Mancini's men managed to keep Norwich at bay for the remainder of the game and remain seven points adrift of leaders Manchester United in second.  Norwich manager Chris Hughton:  "Manchester City showed why they spend the amount of money they do for the offensive players they have, but you can't be 2-0 down so early on and expect to have a good day. "However, we displayed great character and certainly at 4-3 it seemed it might be going our way, but again they showed real good quality. "I cannot fault the endeavour of the players we have got, so now we will look to go again."

23.04.2013 09:51:00 Reading earned only their second Premier League win of the season as Pavel Pogrebnyak's fifth-minute goal  secured a vital win over West Ham. Pogrebnyak latched onto a poor backpass from Hammers defender James Collins, before beating Jussi Jaaskelainen. Adam Federici tipped Collins's header over while Jem Karacan's shot was pushed onto the bar by Jaaskelainen. Substitute Ricardo Vaz Te nodded wide from three yards as the hosts held on to move within five points of safety. The result means the Royals remain a place above bottom side QPR on 13 points, with Southampton (17 points) and Aston Villa (18) above them.  Reading beat West Ham twice last season in the Championship and they made a flying start to the game, Pogrebnyak giving them the lead after just five minutes. Collins under hit a backpass to goalkeeper Jaaskelainen and the Russian intercepted the ball, slotting home beautifully for the opener. The goal settled Reading, who dominated midfield in the opening stages with Jimmy Kebe on the right wing their best outlet. West Ham slowly started to come into the game, threatening with crosses from wider positions, and Collins almost made amends for his earlier mistake with a close-range header that was superbly tipped over the bar by Federici. Nolan also tested the Australian keeper with a curling effort from the edge of the area, while Reading needed several heroic tackles from central defender Alex Pearce to keep West Ham at bay. It was a half low on quality and full of poor challenges, with Mark Noble, Pogrebnyak and Collins all booked, and another four yellow cards following in the second half. Carlton Cole had West Ham's first chance after the break, heading Matt Jarvis's cross wide as the visitors introduced Jack Collison for Matt Taylor to try to give them a grip in midfield. Cole was involved again soon after, stamping on Chris Gunter, with the Hammers forward lucky to escape punishment. As the rain lashed down it became a gruelling battle, with Reading dropping deeper and deeper as they looked to hold on. Collison went close with a low strike that Federici did well to keep out at full stretch, and Karacan crashed a shot against the crossbar from 18 yards. Vaz Te made his return after 12 weeks out with a shoulder injury. And the Portuguese had a great opportunity to level the game but headed wide when unmarked three yards out.  Reading manager Brian McDermott told BBC Sport:  "I'm very pleased. We were very resilient today and we needed to be. We know what we have to do to get results in this league and we move on now and look forward to our next game against Spurs. "We had to deal with facing a very physical side and we have kept another clean sheet. I didn't feel they had too many opportunities. Pavel took his chance very well and we've also hit the bar. "A couple of their players could have been sent off and you saw two teams desperate to win out there."  West Ham manager Sam Allardyce told BBC Sport:  "We shot ourselves in the foot from the early stages. James Collins has been solid for us this season but he made a basic error and they took full advantage. "Reading defended deep and in numbers and Vaz Te has missed a glaring, glaring chance and two errors mean we have not taken any points against them. "We are slipping back down that way now and that is going to put pressure on us. We should have undone our early error but Vaz has missed it. "We are bitterly disappointed not to come away with a point and now we are without James (Collins) and Kevin (Nolan) through suspension for an important game against Norwich."

23.04.2013 09:51:00 Cameron Jerome's stunning late equaliser denied Southampton and preserved 10-man Stoke's unbeaten record. Substitute Jerome lashed into the top corner from 30 yards to rescue City after a poor first-half display saw them slip 3-1 behind. Three times Saints took advantage of confusion in a City defence that was without suspended pair Ryan Shawcross and Geoff Cameron. Rickie Lambert opened the scoring at the far post and, after Kenwyne Jones' backheeled equaliser, Jay Rodriguez profited from a mix-up, with Andy Wilkinson turning into his own net for the third. The visitors should have made the game safe early in the second half, only for Guly do Prado to miss from the edge of the 18-yard box with the Stoke goal unguarded. It was to prove a crucial moment as, soon after, Matthew Upson scrambled home from a corner. With Stoke down to 10 following Steven Nzonzi's red card for a studs-up challenge on Jack Cork, Jerome produced his moment of brilliance to extend their unbeaten run to 10 games. It was perhaps cruel on Saints, who fully deserved their half-time lead, but Stoke can justifiably claim they deserved a point for the way they battled in a second half. They had two penalty appeals turned down when Jose Fonte and Maya Yoshida appeared to have handled. The Potters may be concerned, though, at the way the tightest defence in the Premier League was so easily breached without the presence of Cameron and, more importantly, Shawcross. Nigel Adkins opted to partner Lambert with Rodriguez up front and, with Do Prado and Jason Puncheon impressing on the flanks, the Southampton manager's positive approach was vindicated. Saints deservedly took the lead as Do Prado turned Ryan Shotton - in for Cameron at right-back - and crossed for Lambert to get ahead of Wilkinson and slot home. Stoke hit back almost immediately, with Shotton making amends to jink past Luke Shaw and square for Jones, whose cool backheel crept inside Kelvin Davis's far post. But, from there, Stoke fell apart. First Lambert had time to collect a long ball, turn and float a cross into the box. Goalkeeper Asmir Begovic looked to have it covered, only for Robert Huth to deflect the ball onto his own bar, with Rodriguez able to tap into the empty net. It got worse for the Potters when Puncheon collected the ball from a corner and delivered a cross that was turned past Begovic by Wilkinson after Lambert's knock-down. Stoke improved after the break, but they should have been put out of the game, only for Do Prado to miss with the goal at his mercy. It was to be Saints' last real chance. Upson pulled one back as the ball bounced around the Saints box, with Stoke then aggrieved as Mark Clattenburg waved away appeals for a penalty when Fonte looked to have handled as Jones jumped for a header. The hosts' sense of injustice deepened when Nzonzi saw red, but Cork was arguably lucky to escape injury from the Frenchman's lunge. Even though they were a man down, City continued to press, with boss Tony Pulis deciding that four of his 10 men should be strikers. Jerome and Peter Crouch joined the action and after more scrambling in the Saints' box and the appeal against Yoshida, Stoke were finally rewarded for their spirit and persistence. Jerome pounced on Crouch's knock-down to fire high past Davis to complete a breathless afternoon at the Britannia.  Stoke manager Tony Pulis: "I thought we were awful in the first half. That's as bad as we've been. We were poor defensively and gave poor goals away, and we looked off the pace. We were slapping ourselves on the back after the Liverpool game. "But we ended up playing with a lot of commitment and desire and we think, even with 10 men, we should have won the match. It was a fantastic game for the supporters, but not for the manager."  Southampton boss Nigel Adkins: "Stoke have only conceded four at home all season, so for us to have scored three is outstanding for us. We weathered a storm and it took a wonder-strike for Stoke to get a point. We are always positive and we can always score goals. "We have matured all season and it's excellent to win a point at Stoke. We have a team that are showing a great character and a great desire to do well in this division."

23.04.2013 09:51:00 Tottenham won their sixth league game out of eight as they came from a goal down to beat Sunderland and move up to third in the Premier League. Gareth Bale headed wide and Emmanuel Adebayor's two-yard shot hit the bar, before John O'Shea side-footed in from close range for the Black Cats. Sunderland's Carlos Cuellar headed into his own net for Tottenham's leveller. Spurs winger Aaron Lennon sealed the comeback when he burst through on goal and coolly slotted home. Jermain Defoe and Adebayor should have given the scoreline a more emphatic look but the Spurs strikers were denied by keeper Simon Mignolet. Spurs winger Gareth Bale was again booked for diving and, although there did appear to be contact when he was challenged by Craig Gardner, he will miss his side's next game following a fifth yellow card of the campaign. The Welshman later insisted he had been unfairly singled out.  Sunderland beat Manchester City on Boxing Day but, despite taking the lead, could not cause another upset. Both teams went into the match in good form and the early stages involved them battling for some sort of superiority. However, the defences of each club were proving disciplined until a mistake by Black Cats midfielder James McClean after 25 minutes sparked a spell of Spurs pressure. McClean lost possession on the halfway line and Lennon slid a pass to release Adebayor, whose shot was saved with his foot by the on-rushing Mignolet. Almost immediately, right-winger Lennon skipped past a defender and sent in an inviting cross which an unmarked Bale steered wide from 10 yards. Soon after, Cuellar mistimed a clearance from a Defoe shot and, even though Adebayor beat Mignolet, his poked shot came back off the crossbar. The visitors failed to capitalise and were punished when they failed to deal with a set-piece. A Sebastian Larsson free-kick to the near post fell for Black Cats striker Steven Fletcher and, after his shot was well saved by keeper Hugo Lloris, the loose ball was slotted in by O'Shea. But Tottenham have an impressive away record this season and racked up a sixth win on the road with a second-half fightback. The visitors were gifted an equaliser when Cuellar headed Kyle Walker's near-post corner into his own goal and quickly conceded a second. A Lennon pass came back off Sunderland defender Matthew Kilgallon to the Spurs winger, who flicked the ball past O'Shea before producing a smart finish. The closest the home side came to a leveller was when Spurs keeper Lloris parried an Adam Johnson strike but it was the visitors who looked the more likely to score. Defoe chose to control and shoot from a Bale cross rather than go for a first-time shot, allowing Mignolet to scamper across and block his strike. Mignolet also came out of his goal to save an Adebayor shot late on as Spurs advanced their chances of a top-four spot.  Tottenham manager Andre Villas-Boas: "It was extremely good. Apart from the Everton fixture we have had an excellent December and to finish the year with a win like this is very good for us. I am very happy for the team. We have played a tremendous amount of games in December and it's good to get this result. "Sunderland are difficult, but to be fair we dominated most of the game. Sunderland had a go but we had the most amount of possession and the most amount of shots. In the end we got the win that we wanted."
