West Ham's Jaaskelainen was the busier of the two goalkeepers now, saving brilliantly from Esteban Granero's shot after a clever touch by Cisse, although Carlton Cole should have made the victory more comfortable for West Ham but prodded wide with the goal at his mercy after a slide-rule pass by the tireless Nolan.
