  abstract = {Web mining aims to discover useful information and knowledge from
	the Web hyperlink structure, page contents, and usage data. Although
	Web mining uses many conventional data mining techniques, it is not
	purely an application of traditional data mining due to the semistructured
	and unstructured nature of the Web data and its heterogeneity. It
	has also developed many of its own algorithms and techniques.Liu
	has written a comprehensive text on Web data mining. Key topics of
	structure mining, content mining, and usage mining are covered both
	in breadth and in depth. His book brings together all the essential
	concepts and algorithms from related areas such as data mining, machine
	learning, and text processing to form an authoritative and coherent
	text. The book offers a rich blend of theory and practice, addressing
	seminal research ideas, as well as examining the technology from
	a practical point of view. It is suitable for students, researchers
	and practitioners interested in Web mining both as a learning text
	and a reference book. Lecturers can readily use it for classes on
	data mining, Web mining, and Web search. Additional teaching materials
	such as lecture slides, datasets, and implemented algorithms are
	available online.},

  title = {Simple tricks for improving pattern-based information extraction
	from the biomedical literature},
  journal = {Journal of Biomedical Semantics},
  year = {2010},
  volume = {1},
  pages = {9},
  number = {1},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND:Pattern-based approaches to relation extraction have shown
	very good results in many areas of biomedical text mining. However,
	defining the right set of patterns is difficult; approaches are either
	manual, incurring high cost, or automatic, often resulting in large
	sets of noisy patterns.RESULTS:We propose several techniques for
	filtering sets of automatically generated patterns and analyze their
	effectiveness for different extraction tasks, as defined in the recent
	BioNLP 2009 shared task. We focus on simple methods that only take
	into account the complexity of the pattern and the complexity of
	the texts the patterns are applied to. We show that our techniques,
	despite their simplicity, yield large improvements in all tasks we
	analyzed. For instance, they raise the F-score for the task of extraction
	gene expression events from 24.8% to 51.9%.CONCLUSIONS:Already very
	simple filtering techniques may improve the F-score of an information
	extraction method based on automatically generated patterns significantly.
	Furthermore, the application of such methods yields a considerable
	speed-up, as fewer matches need to be analysed. Due to their simplicity,
	the proposed filtering techniques also should be applicable to other
	methods using linguistic patterns for information extraction.},

  title = {An empirical study of the naive Bayes classifier},
  year = {2001},
  pages = {5},
  abstract = {The naive Bayes classifier greatly simplify learn- ing by assuming
	that features are independent given class. Although independence
	is generally a poor assumption, in practice naive Bayes often competes
	well with more sophisticated classifiers.
	
	Our broad goal is to understand the data character- istics which affect
	the performance of naive Bayes. Our approach uses Monte Carlo simulations
	that al- low a systematic study of classification accuracy for several
	classes of randomly generated prob- lems. We analyze the impact of
	the distribution entropy on the classification error, showing that
	low-entropy feature distributions yield good per- formance of naive
	Bayes. We also demonstrate that naive Bayes works well for certain
	nearly- functional feature dependencies, thus reaching its best performance
	in two opposite cases: completely independent features (as expected)
	and function- ally dependent features (which is surprising). An-
	other surprising result is that the accuracy of naive Bayes is not
	directly correlated with the degree of feature dependencies measured
	as the class- conditional mutual information between the fea- tures.
	Instead, a better predictor of naive Bayes ac- curacy is the amount
	of information about the class that is lost because of the independence
	assump- tion.},

  title = {Distance metric learning for large margin nearest neighbor classification},
  booktitle = {In NIPS},
  year = {2006},
  publisher = {MIT Press},
  abstract = {We show how to learn a Mahanalobis distance metric for k-nearest neighbor
	(kNN) classification by semidefinite programming. The metric is trained
	with the goal that the k-nearest neighbors always belong to the same
	class while examples from different classes are separated by a large
	margin. On seven data sets of varying size and difficulty, we find
	that metrics trained in this way lead to significant improvements
	in kNN classification—for example, achieving a test error rate of
	1.3 % on the MNIST handwritten digits. As in support vector machines
	(SVMs), the learning problem reduces to a convex optimization based
	on the hinge loss. Unlike learning in SVMs, however, our framework
	requires no modification or extension for problems in multiway (as
	opposed to binary) classification.},
