  volume = {2},
  abstract = {Web mining aims to discover useful information and knowledge from
	the Web hyperlink structure, page contents, and usage data. Although
	Web mining uses many conventional data mining techniques, it is not
	purely an application of traditional data mining due to the semistructured
	and unstructured nature of the Web data and its heterogeneity. It
	has also developed many of its own algorithms and techniques.Liu
	has written a comprehensive text on Web data mining. Key topics of
	structure mining, content mining, and usage mining are covered both
	in breadth and in depth. His book brings together all the essential
	concepts and algorithms from related areas such as data mining, machine
	learning, and text processing to form an authoritative and coherent
	text. The book offers a rich blend of theory and practice, addressing
	seminal research ideas, as well as examining the technology from
	a practical point of view. It is suitable for students, researchers
	and practitioners interested in Web mining both as a learning text
	and a reference book. Lecturers can readily use it for classes on
	data mining, Web mining, and Web search. Additional teaching materials
	such as lecture slides, datasets, and implemented algorithms are
	available online.},
