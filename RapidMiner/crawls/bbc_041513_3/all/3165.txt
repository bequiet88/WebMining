The game was in urgent need of a goal and it came from the visitors, who hustled Glenn Whelan out of possession to allow Ba to fire a low effort that bounced awkwardly in front of Begovic and Cisse was alert to hook in left-footed off the inside of the post, scuppering Stoke's hopes of a sixth clean sheet at the Britannia Stadium this term.
